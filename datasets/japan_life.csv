A question for those who have experience applying for daycare. I'm 21 weeks pregnant and am planning to take a year of childcare leave after the baby is born in February 2020. 

I have been looking up when to apply for daycare for after that, and on my ward's website it said that the application period was October-November 2019 for those who want to put their kid in day care from next April 2020. (This is what I'm looking at btw: [https://www.city.arakawa.tokyo.jp/kosodate/hoiku\_takuji/hoikuen/faq.html](https://www.city.arakawa.tokyo.jp/kosodate/hoiku_takuji/hoikuen/faq.html))  My questions are...

1. I've always heard that you must start searching/applying for daycare ASAP as there are long waiting lists, etc... so why does this seem so late? 
2. In my case, if I am thinking about daycare for the year 2021 when I plan to go back to work, am I going to have to just wait for now and apply sometime next year? Friends and even the hospital tell me to start looking/applying asap but I'm confused as to when I can actually start applying...

I used to be able to Norikae every 2 years and get the latest iPhone (or 1 generation older iPhone) at highly discounted prices. (For example, the past 2 years I have been using an iPhone 7 with SoftBank for 3,600 yen per month) But this year the law has changed to prevent carriers from discounting the price of their iPhones.

I went to an au-shop today to get a quote and it was over 10,000 yen per month to get an iPhone XR let alone an iPhone 11.

They seem to be pushing for the 4-year contract instead of 2-year, and even then the lowest quote I could get was 7,900 yen per month, which is probably not too bad, but I'm a bit uncomfortable with committing 4 years of that price per month since it is A LOT more money than I payed for my iPhone 7.

The surprising thing to me is that the au-store seems to have higher prices for the phones compared to the Apple Store (for example, a 128GB iPhone 11 is 79,800 yen in the Apple Store but 96,480 yen in the au-store)

I'm considering just buying from the Apple Store and then getting a 格安SIM (Y!Mobile, UQ Mobile etc). But are these carriers reliable? If they are cheaper than SoftBank/au/Docomo then why doesn't everyone go for the cheaper carriers?

I'm graduating language school by March 2020, so I'm currently thinking about my next steps. Even I'm graduating soon, I'm not really that good in Japanese (only between N3 and N2 level). 

I used to work in the film industry in my country so I really wanted to do the same here in Japan that's why I'm considering entering a senmongakkou / vocational school for 2 years. The tuition fee is really expensive though and I'm not exactly rich. It is the fastest way to enter the industry though so I'm still considering it.

EDIT: Sorry I forgot to mention. I already graduated from university in my country before coming to Japan.

I'm also working part-time at an eikawa school as an instructor and I can apply as a manager or something by January so I can start on April. The thing is, this job is bearable, and they can sponsor my visa, but I don't really enjoy the job as much. I don't think I can do it for a long time. It can help me save up and pay student loans though.

I heard if I have a visa from a senmongakkou, I can only work in that field after graduation. Doesn't sound so bad but people says it lowers my chances of getting employed.

I don't really wanna go back home since salaries there are so low. I don't think I can go back to that. Do you have any advice for me? Please help a lost soul out.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

Just got my first commuter pass and the price was a bit of a slap in the face.. I've read some existing threads on the passes but still have some questions!

Context: I currently live in Nishi-Ogikubo and attend a language school in Takadanobaba every weekday. As I heard that while it may look a lot I would likely save a bunch getting a commuter pass rather than pay for individual trips. This is surely true but maybe not by such a margin I expected.

So what I got: My regular route to school is usually with the Chou Sobu line that changes into a Taizo train in Nakano which makes me not have to change trains and it's generally the fastest route, not by a lot though. As such today, I got a commuter pass for the Chou line and the Taizo line, it seems however both of these individually added over 6000JPY to the cost. 

Thus my first question: I only go about two stations on the Taizo line, does my commuter pass cover the full line or just these two stations? Seems excessive for it to cost as much as the, on my trip, much longer Chou Sobu ride but maybe that's just how things work. If so, could I for my next one simply get a renewal for ONLY the Chou line and have the Taizo part paid for by regular cmmuter charge in one trip? As in the Commuter pass simply doesn't charge for the covered area? 

My second question is, should I just start going the Yamanote route with a switch in Shinjuku? It's a little longer a trip (not by much though) but I spend WAY more of my personal time on the Yamanote line so thinking I might have f-ed up by not incorporating that into my getting the pass (I was helped by one of those dudes sticking out his head from a tray and everything happened fairly quickly, I did show him the route with Chou/Taizo though so not his mistake).

Just trying to wrap my head around this. Paid something above 12K JPY which felt a lot but doing some quick calculations on my phone I realized I'd likely pay 15K per month without the pass assuming I don't miss any school and not calculating for holidays.

Thanks a mil in ahead! Any help much appreciated! 

**TL;DR:** Felt paying 12K for my commuter pass was a bit much but maybe it isn't? Should I make my renewal different based on my private traveling?

Fast forward to August/September me and my colleague was starting to grow really dissatisfied/frustrated with our work (mostly management and how inefficient they do things there )  and obviously was talking shit through some app from our company laptop. 

Then, my colleague decided to leave at the end of September and he handed over his laptop/smartphone without deleting anything. (stupid I know...) Basically they found out that we were badmouthing the client and being unprofessional. 

Obviously they didn't want me there anymore, I was told to 自宅待機 and it's been almost two weeks since this whole situation. 

They haven't told me how long they will put me on hold or there might be a possibility of getting fired. I'd like the quit the company anyways because of numerous reasons, one being this shameful/unprofessional one. 

One thing I'm concerned is that I just renewed the contract at the end of September for 6 months. 

On there it mentions that in case of resignation, we must report 3 months prior. 

How do I deal with this situation? Any input is appreciated","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey people! &lt;/p&gt;

——-

Background in TLDR form: My parents are old, my mom has cancer, my sister is a college drop out who works two jobs to make ends meet. She’s hoping to come to Japan for a change of pace and to increase her limited worldly experiences. My husband and I would be her support system and she’d work to financially support herself. We’re all hoping that getting out of her current situation will benefit her. She has been to Japan before for two weeks at the longest. 

Crappy resume: No Japanese, no college degree, no skilled work experience. Very smart and learns fast, is willing to study Japanese.

Job prospects: One, if she passes the interview. I know the manager of the company and have talked to employees with no Japanese ability about how they communicate and how the environment is. Everything is positive, but not perfect. It’s a cleaning job, but it would help support her if she worked either part or full time. The management staff all speak English very well. 

Education prospects: A well regarded language school near me has a one year program that is relatively affordable (¥1,0000,00ish) and supports student visas while allowing their students to work part time. 

Accommodations: She wouldn’t have to worry about accommodations because the school and job are both close to my husband and I. I have his blessing because he has met my sister and we’d work out a rent/chore payment system. (If she wants to stay longer than a year, we would help her find an apartment.) 

Visa: I’m a “spouse of a Japanese national.” My sister could come in on “student” or possibly “dependent,” but her school history makes a straight work visa near impossible, from what google tells me. 

We just need to get her into the country semi-long term to help her change over her visa to something longer - if she chooses to stay longer than the one year we’re currently planning for. I think a student visa would be the absolute best under the usual circumstances, but my parents are retired and battling the American healthcare system right now. My sister has thousands of dollars in loans from her first and only semester in college. It is a difficult situation, but we want to try to make it work if at all possible.

I checked online about how to check whether my Iphone is unlocked or not, but I still can’t quite be sure. I paid off my phone and cancelled my contract, and AU DID tell me that it was unlocked, but it still shows KDDI when I checked the “Cellular” option in the settings.

This isn't about me being scared of the postman. Please stop hating on me for asking a question. 

This might be a silly question, but I've never lived in an apartment before and I'm not sure what to do. 

When receiving mail/packages that I have to sign for, the postman rings the intercom downstairs. There is a button on my doorbell that I can use to open the locked downstairs foyer area where the lift is. 

What I have been doing is saying ちょっと待って over the intercom and then going to meet the postman downstairs. 
I'm not sure if I should be doing that, or if I should be letting him up into the building to come to my apartment door? I don't speak much Japanese and understanding what he's saying over the intercom is difficult. 

I've been looking for answers online and I can't find anything regarding the question. All I can find is about sending parcels.

The Japanese government was very proud to announce that they've updates their emergency system to support 11 languages, a setting which you all probably have on your phone Nd might have no idea how to access. 

I have mine set to English, which does work in Nagoya, but when I got my evacuation alert in Morioka (Iwate) yesterday it was all in Japanese (with only the title and the buttons set to English, based on the app settings). I think this is something that's quite problematic, as the system should be implemented in every region in Japan.

I have lived in Japan now for almost 2 years. My father-in-law passed away at the beginning of this year; he and some of his close relatives had been holding onto a piece of land which was once his home as a child. His brother and family had lived in it until the 90s. They have recently decided that they don't want it anymore, and they are trying to hand it to the local authorities (as far as I understand). My family now has now been asked to agree to the handing over of it to the authorities. I am wondering if there is any point in taking it, rather than giving it away?

I have been to the place before; it's a 30 minute walk from the closest station, in a small town in Chiba (about 40 mins from Chiba city by car). The building on it is at least 70 years old, is derelict and it (as far as I could see) had a lot of old junk inside and outside the property (including an old rusted vehicle). The land has about 6x70ft trees on it, and it's along a busy road. I'm not sure of the land size, but going by google maps it's about 600m²-1000m².

Currently, I have a lot of time (but not much money), so I could do *something* with it if it was worth doing so. I wanted to ask my father-in-law about the land before he passed away, but I didn't get the chance. I always hate to see houses and land left without occupancy, and I think he may have agreed!

What could be done to make the land profitable in some way? I can put in the time and effort to do so, but I don't have a budget. Just time and effort.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

I've noticed a trend. They're a little bit hard to break into. Like they're sort of conservative about sex (not all of course, but the good ones). However... Once you have sex with them, it's like they think you're married.

In America we have a culture of tinder sexing and ghosting after a while is normal. I ghost all the time, it's 2019. However it's like once you have sex with a Japanese girl they think you owe them something. Like, no, it's just sex I am not your anime boyfriend.

More often than not, there is massive fallout. There have even been times that I was afraid for my life. Like you could see their blood boiling and I was anticipating them grabbing a kitchen knife to stab me or something, kind of like how in the Sherlock Holmes movies he pre-visualizes certain outcomes.

Anyone have experience with this? Where do you meet normal girls in Tokyo?

I'm curious how alimony / child support payments and income are regarded in Japan.  Finding my 10 years of L1/N1 level Japanese embarrassingly unable to find a satisfactory answer on the interwebs.

The US has recently changed its laws where the tax burden is now 100% on the payer, and 0% on the payee.  This has resulted in most states having to entirely rework the calculation.  If Japan has a more traditional approach where the payer deducts payment amount from their income, and the payee adds it to their taxable income, how would this effect a situation where the payer repatriates to the US?  The paid amount will be taxable income on the US side for sure.  Is there a double-taxation preventative measure in place?

&lt;p&gt;Just curious to see if anyone that already has a NETGEAR Nighthawk AX8 actually tried doing something like this and has gotten more than 1gbps out of their Nuro Hikari service before I actually drop 50k for it and find out, nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to clarify, I already have a AX200NGW WiFi card installed on my motherboard, so no local wireless network bottleneck,  I hope. 11ax 5Ghz on 160Mhz is capable of reaching speed of 2.4Gbps which is supported by my WiFi card and also what the NETGEAR Nighthawk AX8 is capable of pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

Typhoon Hagibis, currently analyzed as equivalent to a category 5 hurricane (Saffir Simpson scale) by JTWC or a ""violent"" typhoon by JMA. The track forecast from models and agencies haven't changed since yesterday, showing an impact on the Kanto region on the 12th or 13th early morning in a similar fashion as typhoon Faxai that caused heavy destruction and widespread blackouts in Chiba. The forecast can still change but we're beginning to have a good probability on it.  
What conditions to expect?  
Hagibis is expected to make landfall as a category 2 hurricane, probably ""very strong"" typhoon on JMA's scale. Here is a reminder on what is a category 2 hurricane: 

&gt;Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage
Storms of Category 2 intensity often damage roofing material (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon poorly constructed doors and windows. Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their moorings. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely, possibly lasting many days.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Category_2

Hagibis is also expected to be a bit larger than Faxai, which could cause strong winds to blow on a larger scale. Nevertheless, know that a typhoon strongest winds are restricted to a relatively small area. Living in Kanto doesn't mean you'll experience the strongest winds because it depends on *where* in Kanto the landfall will occur. So far the forecasts are leaning for a very similar track as typhoon Faxai, essentially putting mostly prefectures directly surrounding Tokyo at the highest risk.  

Things to remember:   
-Landfall expected in Kanto on the 12th or 13th very early morning. **Precise location might change**. It could also stay above the sea, East of Chiba.  
-Intensity expected to be of a [category 2 hurricane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Category_2) which is more or less the same as typhoon Faxai which severely impacted Chiba in September. A slight change in the intensity forecast might also occur.  
-Expect severe disturbance with transports.  
-If you happen to live right on the final path of the typhoon, wind gusts going easily above 150km/h are to be expected.  
-Infrastructure in Kanto is not really made to withstand such wind speeds. Things will fly.  
-Stocking up on water and other essentials, especially if you were greatly impacted by Faxai, might be wise.  
-I talk a lot about the wind but landslides caused by rain as well as the storm surge might also cause heavy damage.  
-DO NOT go out during the peak. Last time someone got literally smashed into a wall in Tokyo by a wind gust. Local acceleration effects can occur with the high buildings and narrow streets in cities.  

**On the topic of the other regions (notably Tokai and Kansai):**  
-The typhoon will be large enough to disturb the weather to a certain extent, even with a landfall in Kanto.  
-There's still a chance that it might make a landfall notably in the Tokai region, Shizuoka being the most at risk.  

For people without TV who wants live news:   
https://news.yahoo.co.jp/ (Japanese). Two channels available, 日テレ News and TBS news.   
https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/live/ (English, might report a bit less often on the typhoon).  

EDIT (10/10 3pm): Rain is expected to fall about **twice** as much as during Faxai according to this [article](https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20191010-00011152-weather-soci) (Japanese). An emphasis must be put on landslides prone areas, and areas situated near rivers.   


EDIT2 (10/10 8:15pm): JTWC (USA) comment is predicting a ""A QUICK LANDFALL NEAR YOKOSUKA VIA SAGAMI WAN"". Sry for the caps, this is how they publish their [bulletin](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/products/wp2019prog.txt).  


EDIT3 (10/10 9pm): A landfall with an intensity more akin to a [category 3 hurricane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson_scale#Category_3) can't be excluded.  

EDIT4: (11/11 12:40pm): **Don't forget that train lines will be highly disturbed or outright won't run all day tomorrow and going into Sunday morning, please check out how is your line doing before considering riding it.**  
Landfall still expected in a region going from Shizuoka to Chiba at category 2.  


EDIT5 (11/11 11pm): Intensity at landfall remains expected to be of a category 2 but JMA is now expecting wind gusts potentially upwards to 240km/h (which would be extremely destructive). JTWC is at 195km/h. Either way, this is again *potentially* record breaking. I can't reliably say that this will happen on land but expect some pretty intense stuff.

EDIT6 (11/12 10:40am): Beginning of peak bad conditions at around 6pm for Tokyo (center should pass over at 9pm). Count a few hours early for Shizuoka (Izu) where the landfall should occur. Heavy rain is already making [rivers at risk for flooding](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/suigaimesh/flood.html) in many parts of the Tokai and Kanto regions and in some parts of the Kansai region. [Landslide risk](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/doshamesh/) is ""extreme"", notably in central Izu peninsula and Western Tokyo. Wind gusts might reach 200km/h in all the regions directly in the path of Hagibis which would be record breaking and very destructive.  

EDIT7: Chiba has been affected by [what seems a tornado this morning](https://twitter.com/nhk_news/status/1182828601101750272?), with high destruction on a small area. Several evacuation orders have been issued even in central Tokyo (notably for aged persons), please check out your local city website if you didn't get any message.  

EDIT8 (11/12 7:40pm): Biggest threat to Tokyo and other areas might be overflowing from the rivers. [Monitor](https://www.jma.go.jp/en/suigaimesh/flood.html) their level.

- I was expecting 3 months of “garden leave” pay, which is in my contract. Although the terms make it clear that “the company reserves the right”, not that they are obliged, but both my boss and another senior manager said that usually this is provided without any issue.  
- Now I talked to my bucho who was obviously unhappy with me leaving, and he said that I will not be getting garden leave. He will give me

- Now I’m hearing from lots of people that it was not a good idea to quit. It’s better to get fired in some cases, or at least “refuse to leave” and come to some kind of severance settlement.  
- I haven’t signed any papers, only send the letter (email) offering my resignation.

What should I do? I don’t want to burn any bridges, at least more so than I have already. But I also feel like signing this document prematurely is not in my best interests, considering I have no new job lined up.

Do I have any bargaining power here? Can I negotiate the signature with say 1-2 months salary so that I can actually find a new job? Should I just recant the resignation and say I “changed my mind”? Is the 1.5 month extension a good deal? Or have I already dug my own grave and should just suck it up and take what’s coming? 

Again, as the title says, I’m a pretty good software engineer (PhD in computer science), but I’m pretty stupid socially.

And made me curious how everyone else is doing in Japan working. Do you like your current job? Or hate it? Why? I thought this would be a good occasion to brag or vent about your career here in Japan.

I'll start first.

So I've been at this Ad Agency in Fukuoka for a couple years now.

Things I hate: Overtime. I realize it's expected for an ad agency. But there isn't a good balance between being super busy and being bored. Every month is different; I could do about 100 hours of overtime in a month or down to 20 hours. It's nice when I don't have to overtime, but I get judged by my co-workers for not being busy and going home at 定時.

I thought maybe, just maybe, things would be better after the 働き方改革 taking place since April, but more people just end up doing undocumented overtime, which makes me sad for them. But I guess that's Japan at its best.

Another point that's started to bother me lately is the open office concept. This is really bad for me who's more introverted because there are so many distractions at any given time. I basically have no privacy as anyone and their mother can see what I'm doing, oh, and let me also tell you that I'm sitting next to my boss perpendicular to his desk.

Things I like: Pay is decent for my age. And I get overtime pay as documented. You can take flex time off, but it's also frowned upon for some reason. I'm not being micro managed and tend to go in a direction I want. I get two bonuses in a year, about 2.5x my monthly rate.

Things that piss me off: People who overtime everyday until midnight and sometimes past midnight telling me to ガンバレ.

I suppose that's my situation for now, and as I write this down, doesn't seem that bad. But I hate the Ad industry, and that's why I'm looking to get out, preferably to client side, where I can have more of a work/life balance. Many work I end up doing is to win a pitch. If I win, I get showered with work that end up taking 100 hours of overtime, or if I lose, the work I did means nothing and is thrown to the trash; rinse and repeat until you're braindead.

TL;DR I hate the combination of Japanese work culture x Ad Industry. I'm not willing to devote my life to work like many people at my workplace, so I tend to look bad. Bad mental health in general.

A lot of people have suggested to just go for a place and shoot, and when the police or whoever show up, apologize or run away. That wouldn't be a good idea for obvious reasons (the costume is very obvious and would be hard to hide).

Hi again everyone,

Thank you all for your advice and help, long story short I've opened an account with JP Post finally.

As few mentioned, I most likely was stuck in translation hell loop and what they meant was not translated properly to English. To give future advice to those that went through what I did. I also got advice from school, but they did not help me whatsoever. Gave me a simple ""things changed very fast, too bad and good luck""

SMBC Prestia will let you open an account under 6 months**if** you have a part time job with a student visa. They have no problems opening one up for working visa though.

Every other bank besides JP Post are now supremely strict on the 6 month rule, no questions. This is due to the government putting pressure on the financial institutes to stop laundering and fraud, but mostly laundering. The headmaster said this has become such a problem from foreigners that they'd rather deal with the backlash than continue letting it happen.

Onto the more proper part;

Long story short I found a branch even closer to me in Kanagawa and it was the most helpful branch I ever tried. I went by myself and struggled along with my pathetic Japanese and they were more than willing to help me open a normal account + cash card in the mail. Absolute far cry in customer service versus the Metro Tokyo area branches.

Like me, if you are on a student visa, they require either an acceptance letter or student ID. You also need a JP phone number, registered residence card, your ""My Number"" (for overseas remittance) as well as some sort of ability to read the forms, no English is present.

You do not have to go to your local JP Post branch, but it is advised to as they will start asking why you're opening an account away from home, or they'll just turn you away.

I am now mostly settled in and enjoying the not driving life. Thank you all again, and stay safe during the typhoon!

Hi there,

As stated in the title, no banks are allowing me to open a new account. They're all **very** happy to see me open an account, until I show them that I arrived just after a week ago. Most are applying the ""after 6 month"" rule, some are disallowing me as a student as I'm not technically immediately working, and a lot are turning me away simply because my Japanese is terrible. Today I brought a friend to try expediting the process but I just got more clearly translated to what I already know (6 months, no student visa, this bank wont work if you dont actually know japanese, etc)

I know they're trying to cut down on the laundering and scandals, but I absolutely cannot function without an account.

Some basic info:

* Just arrived about a week ago.
* On a Student Visa for Japanese language school.
* Living in Kanagawa Area, going to school in Shinjuku area.
* I have a PT Working Visa.
* My Residence Card is registered.
* I have a ""My Number"" paper slip.
* I have a Japanese phone number.

Banks I've Tried:

* SMBC
* SMBC Prestia
* MUFG
* JP Post (in Shinjuku)
* Shinsei
* Bank of Yokohama

I'm beyond frustrated and am at a lost for what I can do. Am I doing this procedure wrong or is it truly that hard to open an account? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I've been going at this for 2 days now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: (10/12/19)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi again everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for your advice and help, long story short I&amp;#39;ve opened an account with JP Post finally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As few mentioned, I most likely was stuck in translation hell loop and what they meant was not translated properly to English. To give future advice to those that went through what I did. I also got advice from school, but they did not help me whatsoever. Gave me a simple &amp;quot;things changed very fast, too bad and good luck&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMBC Prestia will let you open an account under 6 months&lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; you have a part time job with a student visa. They have no problems opening one up for working visa though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every other bank besides JP Post are now supremely strict on the 6 month rule, no questions. This is due to the government putting pressure on the financial institutes to stop laundering and fraud, but mostly laundering. The headmaster said this has become such a problem from foreigners that they&amp;#39;d rather deal with the backlash than continue letting it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onto the more proper part;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short I found a branch even closer to me in Kanagawa and it was the most helpful branch I ever tried. I went by myself and struggled along with my pathetic Japanese and they were more than willing to help me open a normal account + cash card in the mail. Absolute far cry in customer service versus the Metro Tokyo area branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like me, if you are on a student visa, they require either an acceptance letter or student ID. You also need a JP phone number, registered residence card, your &amp;quot;My Number&amp;quot; (for overseas remittance) as well as some sort of ability to read the forms, no English is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not have to go to your local JP Post branch, but it is advised to as they will start asking why you&amp;#39;re opening an account away from home, or they&amp;#39;ll just turn you away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now mostly settled in and enjoying the not driving life. Thank you all again, and stay safe during the typhoon!&lt;/p&gt;

This seems to be an ongoing issue, and you can see a lot of people are complaining about it online. 

I recently added a card for my wife under my account, and it seems, in doing so, I inadvertently clicked on a point promotion, which defaulted the account to revolving payment. 

This is a bit of a scammy process, and it seems a lot of people have fallen for it lately. It also appears as a banner point promotion in the E-navi, so be careful.

Solution: So far, I believe the best solution is to: (1) Cancel revolving payment. (2) Reset revolving repayment limit to max, (3) wait for the amount to be charged in full next bill cycle. It looks like I am going to have to eat any fees incurred in the process. 

TLDR: Rakuten is shifty. Check your bill, make sure you are not being charged “リボ“payments this month.

Are there agencies that have unfurnished apartments with lease terms of about a year or less?

I have a medium term visa (1 year), which is a shorter period than, from what I’ve seen, the shortest contract period of most unfurnished apartments (2 years).   I have been told by a couple agencies so far that based on either the term of my visa or the absence of a Japanese emergency contact, it would be hard for them to find a property owner who would be interested.    


Alternatively, would landlords be interested if you indicate the intention to renew the visa repeatedly?  Or is intent meaningless (I assume it is)?

The page does not have link for the document, nor it is specific to what should be included on it.

**So our question:** is this Affidavit / Statement simply a document that we write ourselves, explaining that we want to change our child’s name on his new passport, or if this is an official application that we need to fill out and can download?

&lt;p&gt;We have been going through the list of documents needed here: &lt;a href=""https://jp.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-family-matters/reporting-birth-checklist/""&gt;https://jp.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-family-matters/reporting-birth-checklist/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the list of items that the US Embassy requires, we apparently need to make an □ &lt;strong&gt;Affidavit/Statement Requesting Name Change&lt;/strong&gt;. But we are not sure exactly what this is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The page does not have link for the document, nor it is specific to what should be included on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So our question:&lt;/strong&gt; is this Affidavit / Statement simply a document that we write ourselves, explaining that we want to change our child’s name on his new passport, or if this is an official application that we need to fill out and can download? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this all makes sense, and if someone here has been through the same process, please let us know what you think. Thank you for the help!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm wrapping up 14 months living in Japan and just want to make sure I'm not crazy... 

Countless times since I've lived here, I've gone to a place (that usually I'm really excited about) and there will be a sign on the door saying that it's closed that day, randomly, often listed without reason. Off the top of my head in recent memory, this has happened at an AU shop during open hours on a random Wednesday, at a popular restaurant in Kanazawa I'd walked 25 minutes to; a Kanazawa brewery on a separate day I'd taken an expensive cab to while my mother was visiting; a hidden brewery in Kyoto we spent 30 minutes trying to find in the hail (to be fair, upon deep investigation, that place was closed the first Monday of every month); a bar on a random day for no reason; and many more. 

In the United States, this almost never happened. Like, it would be extremely rare to go to a business that I know is usually open during their hours, and find that it happens to be closed; and if it was, there was always a reasonable explanation.

And it's not just hours and closing -- countless times, I've shown up to restaurants looking forward to a certain item that ether I'd seen on a menu online, or had in the past, and they're randomly out of it. 

Either: 

1. It's just as common; and I'm just less prone to noticing the hours because I'm a foreigner (i.e. don't really follow these businesses' social media or don't notice any posts because it's all in Japanese; am more hesitant to call a place ahead of time to double-check than I would be in the states) 

or

2. It really is more common in Japan and others have experienced this, too.

These are the facts about me leaving Japan and returning to my home country.

* I have a valid work visa/status valid until mid 2021
* I am also married to a Japanese national, although never changed my residence status to spouse
* I am employed and plan my official last day in the company to be December 31st, 2019, however due to paid holidays, my last day actually going to the office will be around December 13th
* I have a plane ticket to my home country for the 20th of December
* Company says they will pay me everything on December 25th, but because by that time I wont be a resident of Japan they will have to apply a special tax rate (around 20?) that is worse the normal one
* I plan to come back to Japan for a couple of weeks in January to deal with stuff, luggage, pending things, etc

Considering the above, I am thinking if the following is legal/ok/appropriate.
 
* Can I just tell my ward office that I will be leaving the 31st of December, so my company can pay me on the 25th of December with the ""normal"" rate?
* When I leave on the 20th of December, can I keep my residence card ""just in case"" things don't go well and I need to come back to Japan next year? (If things go wrong I can always get a spouse visa though)
* Is there any problem with the above and then entering Japan for a couple of weeks on January? I am afraid after telling my ward office I am leaving on the 31st of December they might think I am just trying to avoid paying the residence tax (which I am). I just plan to stay a couple of weeks in Japan on January to settle down things but officially move out on the 31st of ~~January~~ December so I avoid paying one year of residence tax.

edit: there a typo. 

edit2: well this developed in a great conversation. I think I will just officially leave Japan on the 20st of December, handle my residence card back on that day and just assume the highest income tax rate for my last salary.

&lt;li&gt;Is there any problem with the above and then entering Japan for a couple of weeks on January? I am afraid after telling my ward office I am leaving on the 31st of December they might think I am just trying to avoid paying the residence tax (which I am). I just plan to stay a couple of weeks in Japan on January to settle down things but officially move out on the 31st of &lt;del&gt;January&lt;/del&gt; December so I avoid paying one year of residence tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: there a typo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit2: well this developed in a great conversation. I think I will just officially leave Japan on the 20st of December, handle my residence card back on that day and just assume the highest income tax rate for my last salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew that was a lot... Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

Gotta fly to California next week quite suddenly on business.  Just realized my California Driver's license is expired.

Now legally speaking as a non-resident of California I am allowed to drive using my valid Japanese license (at least this is what my initial searches of California law tell me).

But as this trip is work-related I need to be sure there are absolutely no hiccups, so I'm thinking of also getting an IDP / IDL, whatever, issued in Japan.  

Does anyone have any experience with this?  Am I overthinking it?

Currently I am either looking to create my own custom wooden workbench to store my electronic equipment (soldering iron, oscilloscope, hot air station) but, I do not have access to power tools like I do back home to make something like this out of timber.

Usually I would be able to find plenty of second hand tables for sale online in second hand shops, but I cannot seem to find a whole lot here considering the handyman scene in Japan is probably not that large compared to the US where nearly every dad is considered a “fix-it” man. Every time I suggest making something like this to my fellow salarymen colleagues, most of them look at me with the facial expression that says: ""Why make this kind of thing when you could just buy it instead from IKEA?"" Obviously the DIY scene here is not so large...

Anyone know where you can submit designs to be custom made at a wooden craft shop or where I could buy or make something similar to this below? I have found a design online here that is similar to what I had in mind. As you can see, it's pretty unlikely that IKEA or Nitori would have this kind of thing.

I've got a bit of a complicated question (perhaps) and while I searched in the subreddit I couldn't find anything to help clarify my situation. So, in hopes of getting this cleared up I'm reaching into the void for anyone's help.

Well, in short, my husband and I (both US citizens) have come to the decision that we agree to a divorce after being together in marriage for a little over years (a couple for 7). We both became married while in Japan (not in the US). Over time we realized that we have drifted apart and it just doesn't work between us anymore. The decision is amicable.

However, because we're both foreign nationals I have no idea where to take this process. We were married at the city hall where we live currently, but in order to divorce it doesn't seem possible to complete that task by filing a 離婚届 because I learned that such a thing is only permissible if one partner is Japanese.

So, I am wondering then, will we need go to a 家庭裁判所 in order to do so? And if so, what are the procedures for that? Can we just mosey on in and state the matter and get it all in motion there? What is to be expected of that?

Neither of us have children and we don't care to split assets. He will return to the US eventually when this is all settled and done. Again, we're better as being friends and have no ill-will toward one another, so I don't see a lawyer as being crux to the endeavor.

As I barely have a good understanding of the Japanese legal system I'm just lost on how to tackle this process.

Any kind of help that can be given would be wonderful. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Found a renovated 中古マンション right next to where we already live (目黒区碑文谷) , looked at it yesterday, and the layout and renovation seems fantastic, the price is doable, and we can definitely picture ourselves there. It's a wee bit away from the station (\~15m), but we're already used to this. However, the one thing about this building is that it's been built in 1995, so we're 26ish years deep.

&amp;#x200B;

I've contacted a few friends for advice; they both have cautioned that since it's older, plus a bit away from the station, it could be difficult to either sell or rent should we want to move in the future. Although we don't have any plans in the near term to do so, not having that freedom also sounds pretty rough. This does seem like sound advice, however both are speaking from the perspective of having bought newly-constructed マンション themselves, so haven't bought this sort of unit.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, I'd be curious if anyone here has had a direct experience of buying a place like this?

Especially, if you've considered similar concerns around resale or rental.

Previous posts in this sub seem to focus on much older places (built in 70s/80s), but I haven't seen much from folks who have bought in the 1990s age range.

I have a JP bank account but you can't use that for online purchases, just deposits and withdrawals (My gas and electric company can pull money out of it themselves though which is frustrating).

I don't really have many options for online purchases except for buying prepaid visa cards which I would have to buy several of as they come in set amounts. My other option is getting a credit card out here, I just want to know if I can deposit money straight in to a monzo account from one of the bank machines.

If I had to get a credit card, does anyone know what credit cards would be easiest for a foreigner to obtain? I've mainly been looking at just a simple Paypal credit card thats linked to my account at home (My mum would post me the card). Would that be ok or would it HAVE to be a credit card from Japan?

I haven't found many results to depositing money in to Monzo online so I thought I would make a post. There wasn't a megathread either so I had to make my own post.

I've lived in Japan a long time, and consider the lack of religion/belief here a massive plus.

So today, out front of the public school, two old guys were distributing stuff. I took it as just run-of-the-mill juko ads. After first period, a kid stopped me in the hall and tried to give me a Bible. I said, ""no! I don't want that."" A few kids gathered around, and I saw a bible on another kid's desk, and I asked where he got it. He said some guy gave it to him. I told him I wasn't in to it, he could do what he wanted with it, he could throw it out.  I tried to balance out my inappropriate 'fuck-that-shit' attitude with a more professional 'do what you like, but don't litter' attitude.

When i had the chance, I asked the VP if they had asked to hand stuff out. He said yes. I told him I was really surprised, because in Canada, no school would allow that. The advertising in Japan is weird to me, but it was applicable to the kids at least.  As a father though, I wouldn't want someone trying to promote their religion directly to my child, especially with school permission. I left it at that, I told him it wasn't any complaint, just honest surprise at that being okay here.

In the afternoon, he came to me to, I think, just understand where I was coming from. I let him know a bit about Canada; until the late 80s (my youth), Christianity was a massive part of government legislation. There was prayer in school until around '88, Sunday shopping was a massive discussion and weird thing when it was legalized around the same time. The reason was that the government couldn't show support of one religion over another (or none). A huge part of Canada's population is non-Christian, which is why keeping religion out of schools is so important (and don't @me over the Catholic school board, yeah, it's an aberration, and nothing to do with this story).

I asked him if the people who came today were spreading Islam, would he have been fine with it, and he laughed and said of course not. That was something I both expected and was shocked by. For me, I can rank religions in order of toxicity, but they're all pretty close to the same to me.  Just stuff people believe because others do, but the degree to which he considered Christianity innocuous and Islam bad news, well, it shows a lack of curiosity on the topic.  Thats fine.  If I weren't a native English speaker, religion would be a lot more ignorable to me too. I told him its all the same stuff; if you choose which to allow and which not to, its discrimination. He got that, and compared it to a teacher being political in the classroom. I wanted to bring up 1,000 other things I've seen in Japanese schools that are hyper-political, but I let that go.

Hi, I suffer from chronic nerve pain and was looking at CBD oil/vaping in Japan. Typing CBD liquid, I found this site. 

https://mglpl.com/

The red banner said « CBD MAX  ワンコインコース 500 yen», when I first found it.

I read through most of it but skipped the part where they explain the payment plan for the « cannabi plan »

I put my info, used amazon pay and ordered. It’s only when I received the confirmation email that I realized it was an automatic payment plan.

First of all, I know it my fault and I should have been more careful. However notwithstanding the fact that I didn’t read the full page, the course names are misleading. 

My order was for the CBD MAX  ワンコインコース, which name is slightly different than what is written on the webpage (カンナビコース) or in the order confirmation.

[the customer agreement ](https://mglpl.com/info/customer_term) does not mention the names of the plans, but it seems (paragraph 14) that canceling is not possible. 

Tomorrow, I will call (call center opens at 12) and ask to cancel. I expect they won’t accept it and at the very least make me pay the cancelation fee of 7600 yen. If they do so, I will complain that the item I bought (as stated on the confirmation order) is CBD MAX  ワンコインコース, which is not the カンナビコース on the webpage, and as such could not expect an automatic payment plan. 

In fact, the first time I received info about the CBD MAX ワンコイン (or something similar) was after I ordered, which is not legal, right?

I also know the cooling off customer protection does not apply for internet purchases unless you can physically refuse the delivery, which I don’t think I can (it will probably be in a regular Japan post envelope). 

It was late, I was in pain and didn’t think clearly. I feel really stupid, but would appreciate any advice. 

Thank you.

Update 1. Called the customer service where I was told the law prevents me from canceling. When I asked where it was written, the lady read a passage I could not find from the webpage. I then said the item I ordered had no explicit contract conditions on the site (there was mention another item with a slightly different name) and I wanted to cancel because of that. Finally I mentioned the National consumer affairs of Japan, and she said she would talk to her manager and call me back. Waiting for her call now. Also I found that amazon pay has a customer service desk. Since the payment is still being processed (処理中) I could declare the shop as fraudulent and ask to stop the payment. I will wait another hour to get a chance to solve this peacefully.

Update 2, final= got the call. The webpage I ordered on actually had all the legal info on it. I was basing my assumptions on another page (to be fair there is no clear menu). The guy on the phone was calm, but strict, and refused my cancellation. Can’t be mad at him, I guess. One good thing coming out of this is my tat my wife is totally supportive and actually laughing about it since I have been badgering her about her expensive makeup.

Question for app developers. It appears that a lot of the apps made by big Japanese corporations have quite ""old school"" user interfaces and their ratings in the app store are really low too (so it's not just my gaijin preference).

I am a desktop person that prefer Lans over wifi for stability and speed, but I am totally fine if I have to switch to wifi using adapter. Is there a Lan port available? I play offline video games using Steam so I need fast unlimited internet from time to time to download digital games. I also Netflix a lot. Thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m going to start looking for a short-term (approx. 6 months) part time job. Begrudgingly.
I already have a job in Tokyo but this will start in April. I just came back to Japan (Kyoto) from Europe a few days ago. So the primary purpose of this is to make money of course. It’ll cost quite a lot to move to Tokyo and buy all the furnitures and what not. But if I can also have fun and maybe make friends at work that would be awesome hehe

I don’t wanna sound so picky but I’d prefer NOT to get too sweaty or dirty during my shift.
I once had a part time job at a pretzel shop and I was always greasy and my uniform was covered with oil, sugar and all kinds of things. And I’m not about that anymore.

This update comes kind of delayed because I’m still struggling with the outcome of what happened. 

After what happened, I was in some kind of shock and repressed every emotion possible to not freak out, also I was constantly paranoid and even today I can’t look men in the eyes when I’m outside on the streets and get an anxiety attack when I see someone who only looks remotely similar to the rapist. 

I reported everything to the police on March 5th. I went through hours and hours of questioning. I went to the police multiple times. 

My friend who communicated with the police was the warrior who kept calling and asking for updates bi-weekly and my police officer was giving them. But everything felt incredibly slow. 

They needed a specialist who viewed the footage. Then they couldn’t find the man because his apartment address given to the government was empty and he was barely in the apartment.

Every time the police officer apologized that it is taking so long. Once I needed to come in to identify the rapist and they gave me a book full of faces of men. They said he is either in there or not. I instantly knew and pointed at him when I turned the page he was on. 

Every time after talking to the police I felt slipping more into despair.

In the end I just thought nothing makes sense and I just wanted to move on with my life. But the nightmares are horrible and I still have some where his face pops up. 

I got a call that the rapist was arrested on Sunday, 18 August⋅11:30am.

I needed to go in one last time and into questioning again so the prosecutor could make a decision. This was after the rapist was questioned. 3 people needed to convince me to enter the questioning room and I was already crying. I was asked again how much I did drink. 

About every detail AGAIN during the rape. It was so traumatizing and I didn’t realize how much I forgot but I wrote down everything after it happened so I won’t mix things up. 

I got a letter from the prosecutor 1 week later about his decision: ONE sentence. ONE.

That the rapist will not be prosecuted including the rapist’s real, full name. All what I have is his real name. 

I really needed to push for answers.

Well, the rapist was let go after 11 days of detention because there was not enough evidence and of course the guy was trying to save his skin, so for him it was with consent. Funny enough only his consent. 

So the black eye and the inner bleeding didn’t count as evidence. Just the video footage and in the video footage I was not fighting. That he might be involved in criminal activities as the police hinted at to me also was of no use.

They did tell me that they were really rough on him while questioning and that they told his wife and family what he did. Since his name on LINE is the same like on facebook with the same photos, I tortured myself to check it. 

Tons of laughing emoji facebook statuses and asking if people missed him that 11 days and people congratulating him. 

I don’t care about the family or his wife knowing the reason why he was arrested. He should’ve been prosecuted because I was clearly intoxicated and he took advantage of it. I refused and fought the moment I realized he is a stranger but my body was heavy and I felt like in clouds and couldn’t move much. He didn’t use a condom. I could’ve had AIDS or get infected by him, or any other STD or become pregnant without knowing who the father might’ve been since I slept with my husband the night before and then I might have needed to abort the potential child of my husband and this is on top of it super expensive in Japan.

I was considering suicide. I still am. But I try to find reasons to move on.

WHY WHY WHY AND WHAT is attractive in a woman that can’t move while you are on top of her? Why do you risk your own health and potential financial loss(possible pregnancy) just to put a penis into a vagina of a stranger? 

I can’t wrap my head around it! I am bi and every time I saw a woman in that state and had the power (college parties), I took her, wrapped a blanket around her, put her in a safe room on the couch with a bucket next to her and checked in during the night. NO touching, not even the thought crossed my mind that this might be a potential sexual partner. 

You know what really is affecting me, too?

My friends who told me that they got raped after I opened up. One was raped in front of her apartment in Japan (she is Japanese) but couldn't see the guy’s face, another in a club in Serbia, even men reached out and told me from their assault experiences in Japan.

And all men got away with it. Police is slow and women are judged here. Let’s have a look again at the daughter who was raped by her father but the father was let go because she didn’t really fought back?

This country’s laws suck. Take care girls and boys.

If some idiots want to accuse me again of it being my fault for existing and being a woman going out and drinking with friends and not having my husband looking at me with his hawk eyes during every move I make, get out. I don’t care about your opinion because it is wrong and it just tells me you would consider raping a woman if she is weak enough and if you only could.  P into V is really not all that makes sexual intercurse pleasurable and I just pity that prick that thought he had a good night because I assume his wife must suffer a lot. 

Conclusion: I should have met up with the rapist after gaining back my strength and should’ve beaten the shit out of him under disguise of meeting him for a date and then say it was self defense. Not getting talked into trusting the police and waiting over half a year for this outcome. I feel broken, have no trust in men nor Japan. That is the reason why the rate of criminality is that low and Japan is considered safe. Many women don’t report because of embarrassment, guilt and fear and the fetishizing of rape and virginity in this culture.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/b4x3mm/got_raped_in_tokyo_now_the_police_want_me_to/""&gt;Previous post here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So this is what happened...

The buyer opened a ""cancel transaction"" window because I took long to ship an item. All I can understand is that I have 24 hours to respond yes or no. I clicked on disagree and it transferred me to a text box with the item # and a reason for disagreement. I type in my reason and click on submit but it says I won't be able to read/send any messages between the buyer and I after submitting, so I closed the window. I messaged the buyer apologizing, saying I sent their things already and to cancel the cancellation, but they haven't responded. I know I'm very irresponsible and stupid for waiting until the last minute to send it. Lesson learned..

What can I do in this situation? Anyone have a similar experience?  Also, I just may be stupidly blind, but I cannot for the life of me find anywhere on the app or site an option to contact customer support, if that's even possible...

Tldr- Eikaiwa. Started in July. Haven't been paid on time for either two pay days so far. Want advice.  


I've been working at an Eikaiwa Since the 1st July. Pay day is, as my Employment Contract states, scheduled to be ""paid on the 20th day"". My first pay day (20th August) was not paid on time.  I told them that I hadn't been paid; they apologised and quickly sorted it out, the money then subsequently arrived the next day. Mistakes happen of course and it was my first pay day, so I didn't think much of it.

Now, its the 21st September and like last time, they haven't paid me yet. This is a real problem for me because I have bills to pay, which I'm currently using my savings for.  


I will talk to the staff tomorrow and hopefully it will be resolved, but I want to know what I can do legally, if anything, should this happen again. I need a reliable payday.

I am part-owner of, let's say, a toy company, and I have a business partner who is also co-owner of the company.  My business partner (who is CEO of our company) recently got in touch with another toy company, which is abroad, and they want him to invest in their toy company.

Our business model is: a big-brand toy company in Japan hires us to design and manufacture toys according to their specifications.  We then either produce the toys ourselves, or hire outside companies abroad to actually fabricate those toys, to the Japanese-client's spec.  Please note that the Japanese client is completely aware of this offshore fabrication system of ours, and are totally okay with it.

My question lies in this: one of our offshore fabrication partners approached my business parter, personally, to invest in their company.  If my business partner does invest in their company, would this be considered a conflict of interest?  Our own company in Japan produces toys, as well as consigns outside companies to produce for us.

I am thinking that it might be conflict of interest (but I am okay to be wrong!).  The issue I am considering is: since we have other offshore fabrication partners that we deal with, if my business partner has a vested interest in one of them, I would be unsure of the reasons to choose them to produce toys for us in future.  Instead of choosing fabrication companies based on their skill, price, quality, etc. I would be always wondering if there is that investment that my business partner has in that one company which is driving the decision to choose them, every time we do make that choice.

Am I over-thinking this?  Are there legal boundaries that pertain to this kind of thing, especially with regards to company owners/CEO?

To those of you looking into this, here’s the experience I had. 

First got a Mirena inserted 5 years ago in America. As my five years was coming up, I decided to ask my gynecologist about it during a regular checkup . When she first brought it up, she said to me that the Mirena is covered by insurance to cover heavy bleeding after I mentioned that I want it for birth control and for lesser periods. Basically, it seemed she was hinting at me to say that’s what I wanted it for so she could tick a box on the computer and get it covered for me.

So, today I went in for an appointment thinking we’d discuss the insertion and then schedule a day for it. She again asked about my reasons and I vaguely said that I had troubles with my period as saying that I had excessive bleeding would be outright lying (my periods have always been fairly light), which seemed good enough for her. 

Well, I went to the exam room and was propped up. And just as I was thinking, wait a sec, there was a slight pain and she said she’d taken it out! She then went to insert a new one, which I let her do since I supposed now was a good of time as any since I hadn’t had sex in the last couple weeks due to my fiancé traveling (though reeeeeally she should have asked about my sexual activities before taking out the old one).

I wasn’t expecting, so I hadn’t taken any pain meds and it felt like a fucking bitch just like the first time, though it was over in less than a minute. Afterwards I felt like throwing up and actually ended up doing so in the hallway bathroom after paying my bill. I wasn’t given a pad, so I crumpled some tissues into my underwear since I was wearing new ones.

Anyway, onto my one really happy point! Since it was covered by insurance, it ended up costing me ¥10900. I’m from America where the cheapest could get away with would be a Liletta for $700+ dollars, so in the end, despite it all, I’m happy that I was able to change it over without too much hassle. 

So now I’m sitting in the bathroom at my home chilling while the urge to throw up goes down and I can take some pain medication.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tll;dr - Surprise iud renewal, was not prepared with pain medication or pad buuut was really happy about the price! &lt;/p&gt;

Just wondering what to do as she has a good relationship with my boss.

Ok, so this lady, is one of our main MCs at a few events.

She was being quite nice with me up until something happened the week of the typhoon. She wanted to come and get a staff t-shirt for an event, so I said sure, let's do it Monday.

Hoooowever, a text came on Sunday from my boss that work was cancelled for Monday. I immediately let her know our office was closed for the typhoon. She then replied and gave me some limited time frames she could come in and get the t-shirt.

The typhoon week was busy with a shortened timeframe and lots of meetings as well, and I needed to get her in that week for the t-shirt. On the day she was set to come in to grab a shirt, an important meeting time changed. The request came in late and it slipped my mind that I needed to let her know.

During the meeting, I remembered about 30 minutes late of the meeting time and even went back into the office to see if she was still there.

We always have admins in the office, and they had given her the shirt. The admin said she had already left.

She wrote me a quick, curt message saying she had gotten the tshirt from admin. I apologized to her.

I had something I needed to confirm from her today, and she was even more curt this time. Beforehand, she had been very casual/Japanese cutesy-style, but now she is using Keigo. I think she's still super pissed about it two weeks later.

I apologized I wasn't able to give her the shirt in person, but I think she's taking it overboard. She got what she came for. Did I need to personally hand her the shirt?

Also why do I have to deal with this temper? I'm her client for god's sake...

I wouldn't be so worried about it but she has a good relationship with my boss. Her cutesy act works on him. Not really on me.

For anyone saying I screwed up, yes, I didn't give her the t-shirt in person, but she did get it, and I've apologized twice now. I think she's taking it too far. Right now, I'm just looking for advice on what to do with a scorned Japanese woman.

I'm also asking this in Japanlife because I believe Japan is one of the only countries that would hold a grudge after two weeks over something like this.

When I looked up bootcamps in Tokyo, I saw Code Chrysalis.

Here’s my current situation:

I’m a JET participant just in my second year, and looking to the future. Living here for a while has been a life goal accomplished and I’ve got no regrets in that department, but I’ve also decided that I’d like to make the move into tech. I’ve been working through the process of teaching myself to code (using App Academy’s open curriculum) for the past few months, and have really taken to it. I like programming, and I think I’m grasping concepts at a decent pace. I think I could do this as a job.

What I don’t know is whether there’s any chance I could make that transition whilst staying in Japan, specifically moving to Tokyo. I’m not bilingual - my Japanese is enough to make basic conversation and read (slowly) most things that I need to, but certainly not business-capable/fluent. And, assuming I manage to build up my coding skills and a portfolio in the next year, I’d still be an inexperienced self-taught new dev.

I’m not against going back to my home country (UK) and trying to make the career change there. I want to stay in Japan mainly because I’d like to spend some time living in Tokyo. It’s not impossible for me to go home, get some experience, then come back, but I’m getting on in life and it might not seem so doable later down the road. 

My question: are there any opportunities for self-taught, non-Japanese-speaking entry-level software developers in Tokyo/Japan? Has anyone made a similar transition from English teaching to software in Japan? It’s a long-shot, but I’m curious!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

After about two months of job hunting in Tokyo with many dead ends, I finally got a part-time assitant job at a nursery (two specified weekdays, and one weekend).

After two weeks of learning and getting used to the routine of the kids, I got a message that next week, the nursery were going to replace me with another fellow employee that would be going full-time (weekdays). They said that they would like to have me on as a substitute assistant if/when the occasion arises.

I'm angry and hurt. Are they allowed to do this? In my contract my employment ends (at a specific time) next year. I'm also one of the few native English speakers at the nursery, and the person going on full-time isn't. If this follows through, I'll only have one work day a week.

What do I do? I haven't replied to the message yet. By the way, this is my first job in Japan. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!

&lt;p&gt;After about two months of job hunting in Tokyo with many dead ends, I finally got a part-time assitant job at a nursery (two specified weekdays, and one weekend).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of learning and getting used to the routine of the kids, I got a message that next week, the nursery were going to replace me with another fellow employee that would be going full-time (weekdays). They said that they would like to have me on as a substitute assistant if/when the occasion arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m angry and hurt. Are they allowed to do this? In my contract my employment ends (at a specific time) next year. I&amp;#39;m also one of the few native English speakers at the nursery, and the person going on full-time isn&amp;#39;t. If this follows through, I&amp;#39;ll only have one work day a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I do? I haven&amp;#39;t replied to the message yet. By the way, this is my first job in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m in the process of buying a 古民家 from  the 1950s.  By all accounts the house is in great shape for it’s age.  It looks to me like the family stayed on top of maintenance and fixed things as they appeared.  It recently had a new roof put on, the floors feel good and the Fusuma slide smoothly so I think the foundation is still pretty straight.

I’m getting this and a yard and a garage, dirt cheap, and I plan to renovate it 90%+ by myself.
I had a guy from a renovation company look at it with me today for free since my real estate company provided that service.

We got up in the attic to look around since I want to remove the ceiling, expose the beams, and insulate/drywall the underside of the top layer (sub-roof?).

The wiring is all tucked up in there and crazy looking.  It’s not even rubber coated I don’t think, something else fabric looking.  The wiring just jumps across spaces instead of following beams like a modern house, so it’s like a 3D spider web.

The renovation guy recommended re-doing all of that wiring and I agree.  It’ll look bad once I open the ceiling and i would feel safer with something more modern.

What kind of costs am I looking at for about 130sqm?  

If I only re-did the area above the ceiling is that a bad idea?  I have no idea what wiring was like in the 1950s.

One positive is that it’s mostly easily accessible.  🤷‍♂️

It’s called “knob and tube wiring”.  It looks just like these pictures.

http://www.edisontc.org/lighting/2016/08/08/knob-tube-wiring/","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soo, I wasn’t going to post on here until the deal was done but this is something that worries me a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in the process of buying a 古民家 from  the 1950s.  By all accounts the house is in great shape for it’s age.  It looks to me like the family stayed on top of maintenance and fixed things as they appeared.  It recently had a new roof put on, the floors feel good and the Fusuma slide smoothly so I think the foundation is still pretty straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m getting this and a yard and a garage, dirt cheap, and I plan to renovate it 90%+ by myself.
I had a guy from a renovation company look at it with me today for free since my real estate company provided that service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got up in the attic to look around since I want to remove the ceiling, expose the beams, and insulate/drywall the underside of the top layer (sub-roof?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wiring is all tucked up in there and crazy looking.  It’s not even rubber coated I don’t think, something else fabric looking.  The wiring just jumps across spaces instead of following beams like a modern house, so it’s like a 3D spider web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renovation guy recommended re-doing all of that wiring and I agree.  It’ll look bad once I open the ceiling and i would feel safer with something more modern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of costs am I looking at for about 130sqm?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I only re-did the area above the ceiling is that a bad idea?  I have no idea what wiring was like in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One positive is that it’s mostly easily accessible.  🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;

I will put a summary first for those who cba to read (totally understandable).

Summary: I was employed with Interac 14th August 2017 (school contract started 25th August 2017) until 16th of March 2018. I was enrolled on Shakai Hoken with Interac. They contributed August 2017 – February 2018 Shakai Hoken but did not contribute for March 2018, likely due to March 2018 being paid out of contract (20th April 2018). But then technically so was February 2018 paid out of contract (20th of March 2018). As a result, I paid National Pension for March 2018 (16,490 yen) and city hall let me off the National health insurance as started a new job on Shakai Hoken 1st of April 2018. The Shakai Hoken break for March 2018 leaves an annoying inconsistency within my pension record and despite paying National Pension for March 2018, I am worried it could affect me in terms of immigration in the future i.e getting longer than 1 year visas/PR. Do I have the right to demand Interac contribute their part for March 2018 (with myself obviously paying the additional deficit of my part of the shakai Hoken contribution)?

Ok, if you’re still reading here is the whole run down…..

I arrived in Japan 13th August 2017 and signed on with Interac from 14th of August 2017 (school contract started 25th August 2017) to 16th March 2018. 

I was enrolled on Shakai Hoken with them (pretty rare for Interac I know). As always Interac pay the 20th of the following month. My Salary was 230,000 a month and a position allowance of 10,000 a month. My transport was never over 10,000 a month. 

Meaning my total monthly pay was between 240,000 – 250,000 per month (apart from August 2017, December 2017 and March 2018 of which was pro-rated). This put me into the 230,000 – 250,000 Shakai Hoken (SH) deduction bracket which meant I paid 21,960 in pension and 11,772 in health insurance (33,732 total). Employment insurance premiums fluctuated based on total pay.

My earnings with them were as follows: Note I will show just total pay (TP) (before tax/deductions) and Shakai Hoken (SH) and Employment Insurance (EI). I won’t include all my other deductions (tax, rent etc as they are irrelevant to the question).

August 2017 (paid 20th September 2017) = TP (87,976)  – SH (33,732) – EI (186)  
 September 2017 (paid 20th October 2017) = TP (248,620) – SH (33,732) – EI (746)  
 October 2017 (paid 20th November 2017) =  TP (247,140) – SH (33,732) – EI (741)  
 November 2017 (paid 20th December 2017) = TP (248,800) – SH (33,732) – EI (746)  
 December 2017 (paid 20th January 2018) = TP (185,940) – SH (33,732) – EI (558)  
 January 2018 (paid 20th February 2018) = TP (247,560) – SH (33,732) – EI (743)  
 February 2018 (paid 20th March 2018) = TP (246,290) – SH (33,732) – EI (739)  
 March 2018 (paid 7th April 2018…Article 23 of Japanese labour law for early pay) = TP (141,224) – SH (0) – EI (424)

As you can see Interac did not contribute to my Shakai Hoken for March 2018 (paid 20th April 2018) salary, despite still deducting 424 for Employment Insurance. At the time I was quite happy with that and thought nothing of it because I had a low salary for March 2018 (paid 20th April 2018) and as a result saved some money because I only had to pay 16,490 for National pension and city hall let me off the health insurance (saving 17,242) as I started my new job 1st of April 2018 (thus enrolled back onto Shakai Hoken) so only needed 2 weeks of health insurance. City hall just instructed me to “Not get injured”.

However, I am now quite keen on remaining in Japan indefinitely and what I don’t like to see is the green block stating ‘国年’on my pension record for March 2018. All my other months have a nice orange’ish block stating ‘厚年’.

But here is my worry. Despite being a bit of a perfectionist, so the ‘国年 looking out of place and also having 1 less month Shakai Hoken which affects my ASR (not much as it’s just 1 month but you know…) my main worry is that in terms of getting more than 1 year visas/PR in the future could immigration look at my record and consider that a red flag/inconsistency on my record? Especially as I was still technically working for Interac up until the 16th of March 2018.

So here is my question. Do you think I would be within my rights to write to Interac requesting it? Obviously, this would require me to pay an additional 17,242 to make up the deficit of 33,732 for my part of the contribution because I only paid 16,490 for March 2018 (National Pension). However, I would be willing to pay that to get my record back in sync with what actually happened in real life i.e I was still employed with Interac March 2018.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry in advance for this long winded question, however after a lot of research I am struggling to find any solid answers so bringing it here to see if anyone can help me out.&lt;/p&gt;

I moved to Japan a couple days ago on a student visa and I'll be staying for 11 or so months (not all the way up to 12 months for sure). I'm choosing a MVNO with 3GB data + voice call sim card and have researched them a bit. The one I've liked the most was biglobe mobile since they have a reduced monthly fee for first 6 months offer running right now and decent speed test results. However their contract is 12 months. 

Now I can think of 2 ways of how the cancellation could work, either I can pay the 12th month already while out of the country AND cancel the contract online from out of the country (after 12th month to not pay a big cancellation fee), or I can't cancel the contract while out of the country (only in person) and as such have to cancel the contract on 11th month, and as such have to also pay the cancellation fee in which case it's really not worth this at all.

Do you guys know if it's possible to do the 1st option?
Alternatively if the answer is no, would you say the best way (cheapest way while also not having unusably slow data) is mineo which doesn't have a 12 month contract?

Alternatively if you've read through this, could you tell me if you get a ""phone number"" (even tho you cant make phone calls) with a dataonly+sms simcard? I assume you have to (otherwise how are you going to receive any sms if there's no number to tell people to send the SMS to) but honestly this whole system is weird and new to me so I had to ask.

I went through some of the previous travel-insurance threads/posts on the subreddit, and some of the recommendations included:

* Sonpo: Their terms seem good(per google translate), but the cover for flight cancellation is limited to 30.000JPY which might be insufficient for a last minute ticket. Is there a way to get more coverage at a higher premium (I couldn’t find such an option on their website) ?
* Tabiho: Their website is very image heavy, not very translation friendly :/
* IMG: Their policies which include public transport delay/cancellation seem very pricey (~110USD for 9 days) (maybe I'm missing something?)

Preparing my PR application I realised that I was supposed to have paid into a national pension for April - July 2015, but didn't. I went to the pension office to try to back pay it but the guy said that they can only take back payments from up to 2 years ago, so there's no way for me to pay it. In my pension payment record, it says 未加 for those 3 months (and everything before that as I wasn't in Japan, so it doesn't stand out). He said that if I did the ""手続き"" (not sure exactly what that would be) now, those three months would become 未納 instead, which is a definite bad. Thus, he said, I should leave it as 未加, which they wouldn't necessarily know is bad for those 3 months.

The problem is that this is immigration, so they can clearly see that I came to Japan in April on a working holiday and I've even written that on the part where you fill out your history in Japan. So if they cross reference that with the pension record, they can see that I didn't pay.

In the PR application form it does only talk about proving that you've paid into a pension for the last year, which clearly I have. But this is PR and it seems quite strict - it would be a nightmare to wait half a year or so and then be rejected because of a tiny amount of money I didn't pay and that is now impossible to pay, which would mean I can't ever get PR...

The amount I didn't pay is about 1.5% of what I have paid since starting my job. Would that be taken into account? Would they even notice in the first place? Was the guy wrong and actually I can back pay it (it seems weird that I can't)? Is there some solution like retroactively applying for an exemption for that period?

Thanks for any and all replies.

time: took about 3 hours from start to finish 

Cost: around 5,000 yen. This included photocopies and photos

Process: arrived at 8:30 and waited to be called. Called at 8:45.  

First stage is an interview of sorts. They check all your documents (passport, translation, licence, gaijin card etc) and ask for you to prove you were in the UK for 3 months.  This was the biggest issue for me before and after and the advice on here was not that helpful. i also called them a week before to clarify what kind of documents I would need to bring. They were quite short with me and told me they will decide on the day. 

So for the record, you need to take a document which has a data TO and FROM. and which hopefully covers more than  months. I get the feeling they did not really care what document it was so long as it had a TO and FROM date. They guy was really persistent on this issue and even rejected a tax form which said ""for the tax year to April 2018"" -he claimed this only had one date on and thus was not valid. I tried to explain that ""to April 2018"" meant it was for a 1 year period but he just rather curtly brushed me off. He also rejected pay slips as they ""only had one date on"". (eye roll).  He rejected mortgage contracts and house buying contracts as, yes,  -they only had one date on. 

Eventually he accepted a gas bill from an email because it had a number of months on it (6 I think). Suffice to say it would have been **very** easy to doctor this. 

The process was easier for the missus as Taiwan stamps passports on entry into Taiwan. 

We then sat and waited for around 1.5/2 hours.  Eventually he called us and told us to go to another counter and pay for the whole thing. 

We then went for a 5 second eye test. Very easy. 

We then signed and dated a couple more forms, one of which asked about health issues. You just basically tick 'no' to all of these. 

Then we had to get photos and photo copies. You could speed up the process by photocopying your whole passport yourself and bringing it but he actually wanted specific pages so it might be easier to let them do it. 

We also had to get photos done as our photos were too big. 

After this it was mostly done. We had to sign one more document saying we had no convictions for driving and then go and have more photos taken. 

After that we got our licences and he took my international licence off me. He also said I have to have a learner sticker on the car for a year. My wife does not, because, I think, there is a reciprocal agreement between Taiwan and Japan.

Prepare for wind gusts going above 150km/h, easily.  
EDIT: JMA seem to UNDERestimate this typhoon strenght. AFAIK, the Americans from JTWC confirms sustained 1 min winds above 200km/h. This is disaster levels.  

Update 1, 19:00 (Tokyo time). JTWC is analyzing this typhoon as a category 3 tonight with a slight weakening. It still has **sustained** 1 min winds of 110 knots, or 203 km/h which put winds gust at 135 knots or 250 km/h *near the centre*. Depending on where you live you might not experience these winds, but they'll be somewhere on land, in the Kanto region, tonight.  

Update 2, 20:00 with all the last information I could gather. JTWC is expecting a landing as a 90 knots typhoon, it's always an estimate, it might be higher, or lower. Sustained winds would be about 165km/h (1 min), gusts above 200km/h near the center. Trajectory still expected to go over central Tokyo. As for JMA they maintained their analysis all the afternoon which I think was wrong, because they completely skipped the intensifying window this afternoon (which temporarily put the typhoon in Cat 4 on Saffir Simpson scale). Note that a ""strong"" typhoon in Tokyo (ie, quite memorable) would leave gusts of about 160km/h. Usually they don't go above 130. Stay inside, bring things that could fly inside as well, secure your bicycles and get water.  

Update 3, 21:00. Kozushima (Izu Islands, South of Tokyo 23 Ku) reported a wind gust of 208Km/h. Currently in the eye.  

Update 4, 22:00. JMA upgraded the typhoon to ""very strong"" status (955 hpa), finally recognizing that it intensified compared to what they were showing this afternoon. Gust at 209 km/h max on Kozushima, currently crossing the eye. Niijima at ~180km/h.  

Update 5, 22:30. Shimoda (Shizuoka) getting into the gist of it. Sign from an Izakaya flying in front of the station live on TV.  

Update 6, 23:20. Evacuation order in effect in Shizuoka prefecture in an area where landslide risk is level 4 (extreme).  

Update 7, 03:40. Haneda recorded a gust at 153 km/h, 176 km/h in Kisarazu, Chiba (reporting power outages). Center of the system is cruising the Tokyo bay, slashing Tokyo and Chiba with different wind directions.  

Update 8, 4:40. Chiba city just recorded a gust at 205 km/h! Might be record breaking.  

Update 9, 07:05. A [tweet](https://twitter.com/gorou_goro/status/1170812788567969792) is showing an entirely destroyed apartment during the night. Typhoon now hitting Ibaraki hard.  

Update 10, 08:30.

My questions are:

(1) Is this the responsibility of the management company or the tenant to drain?


(2) Is the management company obliged to install a drainage system such that it does not flood in the future?


(3) What methods are available to drain it? I am on the 4th floor and there is a garden and other balconies below me so I need to be considerate. I checked online and all the portable pumps seem to be expensive. I have considered a siphon using a hose but I do not want to expel a large quantity of water on to my neighbour's garden.

Hoping to debunk some of his bs, maybe get a little advice on how to proceed.  Sorry it's super long, I've included too much detail perhaps.

TLDR: rented a car from a private owner who found an almost invisible mark and thinks he can do as much excessive repair as he want. I am hoping this is wrong, in order limit excessive costs and vindictive legal issues. And that an insurance company will help tie his hands in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I rented a car on Anyca, an app for renting from private owners. Done a few times before without issues, drove nice cars for cheap, everyone has been cool about letting strangers rent their car. Enter maniac. I booked another for a little road trip last weekend, which was a new listing from a dude who bought a decent german car a month ago. It's over 10 years old, but new to him, condition isn't perfect but it's pretty good.

Drove into the countryside and back without issues. On return, he shone a light over every inch of the car and found a thin line marked on the car. Super tiny, like 1mm wide, could be 10cm or so long. Barely visible, barely touched the clearcoat. Probably from a blade of grass I passed, nothing worse. I honestly couldn't see it without shining light in a specific direction

Dude demands compensation. Weird given the circumstances, but his choice and not the part I have issue with. Trouble is he claims that Japanese law allows him autonomy to determine the level of repair that would satisfy him, but has also played lip service to wanting to keep costs down and avoid something like panel replacement which I thought he meant as worst case scenario of necessary repair, and I said I wanted to avoid high costs too. He added that avoiding insurance would be cheaper because of the high deductible.

Except it turns out he thinks that me saying I was hoping repair wouldn't be expensive was selfish and disrespectful to his now sullied car, despite repeated apologies that I've been giving in hopes of smoothing things over. And also that a respray is appropriate, and became furious when I suggested anything less (ie this would polish out in 5 minutes). Major anger issues that repeatedly flared out of nothing and shut down discussion.

So after a bunch of miscommunications, expressions of anger and apology, threats (he thinks immigration would care about this?), he dragged me to meet in person and after a couple of hours finally produced a couple of estimates that he initially denied obtaining, both resprays, so one was kinda pricey, the other super pricey. I guess he thought he was doing me a favour by getting two, and became furious when I queried them. At this point it was late  We were being kicked out of a cafe anyway because it was so late, he started yelling that I should just use insurance, so I said that'd be fine and walked away.

&amp;#x200B;

So as of today I'm going through insurance, which has a much higher deductible than either quote which is a risk, but at this point I don't mind paying more just to deal with him less, especially now that he's probably hugely enraged. I will send them some photos with nothing to see and they will return a estimate based on repair, not respray, which I have to pass on to him myself (turns out they don't take over discussions).

My concern is that the system really does allow him autonomy to decide on appropriate repair, that an insurance repair estimate may not be adequate protection from further demand. ie if they say that repair should be small, that he still has the right to demand the respray, or if they agree on a respray, he might now want brand new parts etc just to be vindictive.

&amp;#x200B;

Which all sounds ridiculous, and probably is. I hope he's either mistaken, or it was some attempt to make me pay an excessive amount, that would be stopped dead by a third party estimate. But, dudes been stressing me out enough to want to make sure. I'm hoping anyone here may have some idea about this kind of situation and the legal expectation of harmed parties to reasonably limit compensation demands? Is this actually a thing in Japan, or is this just a maniac spouting lies?

This may be a case of ""lawyer up"" and I may set up a consultation to at least figure out my exposure. But I also kinda wanted to get some free advice because this all seems stupid and I could just be getting paranoid.

Note: My license was from Maryland, so I could convert my license without having to take a test.

Prep: Find out what you need to convert your license, and if you need an appointment. I live in Sapporo, and thanks to Google, I was able to find this page which was immensely helpful. You may find it helpful as a guideline as well:  [https://www.police.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/guide/menkyo/gai\_menkyo-kirikae.html](https://www.police.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/guide/menkyo/gai_menkyo-kirikae.html)

Appointment: In Sapporo appointments are required. I called at the end of June and the best they could do was the beginning of September, so call early if your foreign license is going to expire anytime soon.

What I brought:

* My (un-expired) foreign license
* JAF translation of my license
* Driving record for my licence. I paid for a digital, official copy which I printed off at 7/11. In English, as not translated.
* Passport
* Residence card
* Juminhyou (住民票), issued the day before (has to be less than 6 months old)
* Photo of me (taken in one of those booths in a train station)
* PROOF OF AMERICAN RESIDENCE: For me, I paid $15 to have my university send an official transcript. Worked like a charm! In English, was not translated

How it went down - note, this was all done in Japanese:

* I came a bit early, but the guy let me start my process since his other appointment wasn't there just yet. He asked for each required document one by one except the photo. The last item was proof of residence - I gave him my sealed transcript which he opened, and then explained that along with my driving record (which shows my licenses's original issue), you can see that I was in the country after I had originally obtained my license.
* After this, he then pulled out a form and asked me a ton of questions, all in Japanese. I'm N2 level so it was fine other than having him repeat a few things, but if you are not at a high level you will need a friend. The questions were asking tons of stuff about my original test, not all of which I remembered, though he did take ""don't remember"" as an answer. He also asked if I had a license from any other state, and if I had ever lost my license before.
* He took everything and said I had to wait 2 hours for confirmation
* About 2 hours later I come back and he calls me forward, and says everything looks good. Has me pay for the fees (around 4500 yen), get a vision test done, and get my picture taken. Then asks me to wait ANOTHER 2 hours for the license to be printed, giving me an appointment slip
* Around 1.5 hours later, the license was ready, I took it and was on my way

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've heard from friends this process is much easier in Tokyo. It was a real PITA but I'm so glad I got done. I was given a beginner's license after all that.

TL;DR: If you need an appointment call ASAP, don't forget your driving record, get a sealed official transcript if you can.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was trying to figure out how to convert my American driver&amp;#39;s license I didn&amp;#39;t find much information on here- but now that I&amp;#39;ve successfully done it myself, I thought I would share how I got it done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of you have any other stores (especially people from non-English speaking countries), please share in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: My license was from Maryland, so I could convert my license without having to take a test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prep: Find out what you need to convert your license, and if you need an appointment. I live in Sapporo, and thanks to Google, I was able to find this page which was immensely helpful. You may find it helpful as a guideline as well:  &lt;a href=""https://www.police.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/guide/menkyo/gai_menkyo-kirikae.html""&gt;https://www.police.pref.hokkaido.lg.jp/guide/menkyo/gai_menkyo-kirikae.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appointment: In Sapporo appointments are required. I called at the end of June and the best they could do was the beginning of September, so call early if your foreign license is going to expire anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I brought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My (un-expired) foreign license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAF translation of my license&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving record for my licence. I paid for a digital, official copy which I printed off at 7/11. In English, as not translated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Residence card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Juminhyou (住民票), issued the day before (has to be less than 6 months old)&lt;/li&gt;

As far as I understand it, for the **security of account holders** and to satisfy **money-laundering rules**,  
financial institutions have to exercise due diligence in confirming the identity of the recipient.  
The easiest way  to do this is to get an accredited agent of the overseas institution to attest   
id documents (passport, D/L), and send this along with a bill or bank statement addressed   
to the recipient as proof of residence. After asking the overseas institution to contact the office

Documents from the company specify the following statement:   
I certify that this document is a true copy of the original and that the photograph is a true likeness of the holder. 

In Japan it seems that no-one, apart from, perhaps, agents of the company, will make that kind of statement.  
A notary will certify that a person making the statement signed it in front of them.  
In effect, with the above wording, the statement would be   
I certify that this document is a true copy of \[my passport\] and that the photograph is a true likeness of \[me\].   
For JPY 10,800 yen a notary will say that, under a copy of the document, you affixed  in front them   
your 'very signature' to this the declaration.   
With that wording, there is no indication that the notary independently verified the identity of the signatory, which they do, taking copies of passport and D/L and/or alien registration card.

I’ve mentioned a few times my experience and knowledge, and been contacted by a number of people in my DMs. Others can certainly contribute.

Just to explain why I’m qualified to speak on this subject, I’ve worked in the International School industry for about 20 years. This includes being the director of one of the more well-known schools for more than 10 years. I am also the leader of a fairly large organization of international schools, with some of the biggest schools as our member.

Note that since last April I have come to work as an executive at one of the largest Hoikuen firms in the country, due to a government contract to try to create hoikuens that can accommodate the large number of incoming foreigners who will receive the incoming childcare subsidies.

Anyway, the international school industry has changed a LOT these past few years. What used to be a relatively niche industry for foreigners and returnees has become very popular with locals, and what started as NPOs and religious-affiliated institutions has seen a large influx of private enterprises. Many are smaller proprietorships while others are run by Japanese jukus or even banks. Fees are high and this has attracted the interest of those trying to make money. As a result there are a LOT of schools of questionable quality out there.

You should know is that the majority of families at almost all IS these days are Japanese. Some of the bigger, older schools in Tokyo still have a lot of foreigners. This is both because there are so many Japanese interested in international education these days, and because these schools wish to create a stable customer base. Foreign students tend to come and go, and after the 2011 earthquake lots of schools went under because their foreign customer base disappeared. There are really only a handful of schools that have even a 50% foreign ratio these days.

Staffing is another thing. There is a sharp disparity between the bigger schools, which have HIGH salary and benefits. Everyone wants to work there. Some positions are done through overseas hires and the rest are fiercely competed for. This means that those who get the jobs are usually well-qualified, and often don’t quit.

Smaller schools will have all sorts of different people, but many provide low salaries and will hire any foreigner.

Whether you are looking to work at an international school or put your kids in one, the reality is that really only the best ones are worth it. Those schools with better salaries and higher tuitions often do have a higher standard of education. Real curriculums, good organizational systems, strong professional development.

If you want to put your child in an international school…I’m not saying it’s not worth it unless it’s one of the big expensive ones, but choose very carefully and consider if it’s worth the money or not. I’ve seen a lot of schools with no curriculum and untrained staff just robbing parents of money.

If you want to work at an IS, it’s OK to start at a small or medium one and then build up your resume. Work hard and go to as many professional development events through organizations like TAIP, JASCD (if they haven’t collapsed) and EARCOS. Shake hands and get your name and face out there. When a position opens at one of the big schools, it’s a crazy frenzy. Keep trying and if you’re good and lucky, you’ll get one of those positions.

The absolute “top class” of schools in the Tokyo area are, in my opinion:

American School in Japan

British School of Tokyo

Komazawa Park International School

Willowbrook

Montessori School Tokyo

Nishimachi

St. Maur’s

Seisen

Sacred Heart

Yokohama International School

Below that there are plenty of schools that fall into the “good but not great” category. Then beyond that there are just a host of smaller schools that run the gamut from mediocre-to-poor.

I could write A LOT more, but this has gotten long. If anybody wants any more info they can ask…I know quite a bit. Other posters can probably contribute as well. I visited a number of schools in other regions, but I know Kanto best.

I have US Citizenship and am considering applying for Permanent Residency (PR) here in Japan.  But, I also like the idea of being to work abroad (US, EU, etc.).  I have read I would be taxed on all income, global or otherwise, after I get PR.  Does this apply for if I am working &amp; living out of the country? 

I thought the US was the only country that taxes even if you are an expat.  But the wording isn't clear for PR, as to what global income means (and whether it includes living in other countries).  I would rather not live around the world gathering additional countries to further tax me, but I do love life in Japan.

Also does anyone have experience with the 1 year to PR HSP Visa?  Have you applied, and was anything different than a normal application?  We haven't had to pay city taxes yet, but have paid international taxes - how does that work for PR application?

I would rather not live around the world gathering additional countries to further tax me, but I do love life in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also does anyone have experience with the 1 year to PR HSP Visa?  Have you applied, and was anything different than a normal application?  We haven&amp;#39;t had to pay city taxes yet, but have paid international taxes - how does that work for PR application?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are other PR and HSP questions, but not with these specific points.  Thank you for answers and guidance ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

I moved to Japan in April of this year  when the school year started. I'm one of those ALTs out in the inaka, in my case Aichi pref. I'm not with JET or INTERAC but from what I've heard/read it doesn't sound that different from my current experience. My company gave me a long term rental car that I need for work, since one of the 2 schools I work at is 20 minutes straight up a mountain and there's no train or bus anywhere near. Been using it since April for work and sightseeing with my international permit &amp; it's been great.

Got my first speeding ticket today (very stupid of me &amp; definitely overdue tbh) and after a long headscratch-fest with the local cops over my international permit, there's an issue.

Apparently there's a stipulation that for the permit to be valid I need to have been in my home country (in my case the US) for 3 consecutive months before coming to Japan. Problem with that is that I actually visited friends &amp; did some travelling in Japan in late December/January of 2018/2019, about a week &amp; a half. My passport has stamps/landing permissions with the dates. My international permit was issued by AAA on March 25 2019 (clearly marked on the front), so for it to be valid I suppose I couldn't have left the US at all after Dec 25 2018.

My company made no mention of this when they hired me &amp; got me through the visa app process, and since they're fairly small and only a few years old it's likely that this particular case hasn't come up yet (and they hire a lot from all over, not just North America, &amp; those ALTs at least at some point all used international permits). To be fair the hiring process happened pretty fast over the course of March just because they needed somebody to fill a spot and I was eager to get the fuck out of the US. Either way, I called up my coordinator from the company who also didn't know about this and she helped talk with police and ultimately I got to go home (after getting fingerprinted, not fun) with the speeding ticket/fine and a stern ""get a JP driver's license, yankee"" which could've gone a LOT worse.

I wanted a JP license anyway but now my timetable's moved up, fair enough. Another problem though: the required documents for a license include the international permit \*and proof that I was in my home country 3 months before I moved\*???

Local cops may have been friendly enough to let me off, but how do I get a driver's license when I have stamps all over my passport (also required) proving that I wasn't home 3 months before my permit was issued?

Also I know this is at least partially bc a bunch of people from other countries keep hopping back &amp; forth from the Philippines or whatever for international permits without actually getting a JP license, but does that include people like me who were just here for a week just visiting?

Has anyone dealt with anything like this before? Is there any way to still make it at least through the application process with this issue?

TL;DR Short trip to Japan means my international driving permit may not be valid, which means I can't apply for JP license even though I'm a resident with a year contract?

\*EDIT\* My company KNEW I was travelling in Japan in December/January. In fact I met IN PERSON with one of the people I interviewed with over Skype before/after so they knew for sure I was there. Still mentioned nothing about a 3 month requirement for international permit, only told me to get one before I got here.

\*\*EDIT\*\* Thanks for the info everybody! The 3 month rule makes a lot more sense if it applies to the driver's license that got me the IDP in the first place. As much as I hope I'm wrong, this was probably an excuse for local cops to fingerprint a foreigner, probably the most interesting thing for them to do all month out here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi!

I've been reading around, and not getting any good advice on how to cope with living in Japan.

I am struggling with the Japanese culture and systems, especially working for a Japanese company is making me cry nearly everyday.  Been putting up with the bullshit, but I am reaching my limit. 

Considerations points:

- I am from Australia
- I speak good Japanese (I wish I didn't sometimes) 
- I am a woman 
- I am married to a Japanese man with a good job but he doesn't speak English 
- I want children but not with the education, healthcare and pension system here... 
- supportive family back in Australia and here too
- been here for nearly 2 years

Going back to Australia as an option:
- I have no problem finding a job but my husband will have problems finding a job due to the language barrier and we will have visa stressors.

Staying here as an option:
 - I need tips on how to cope in a Japanese company without being a pushover? Without losing my ability to speak up? (already lost 50% of it really...) 

Also to consider: Having a child here also means they might grow up in a society where their voice and opinions won't get heard.

Long-winded comedy of errors follows.

Is it actually possible to buy contact lenses more than two months at a time?

I want to buy a year's worth.

I've had bad experiences in the past buying contact lenses in Japan (I live around Nagoya, not Tokyo FWIW).

- one place I used to buy from suddenly stopped stocking my lenses and just said they couldn't get more without a thorough explanation.

- one place I went to, asking for a pack of lenses, created a prescription for me, but it turned out the prescription only lasted one month!

I've been short sighted all my life, worn glasses since 3 years old.

Every time I get a new contact lens prescription, it's the same. At my age (40) my eyes don't change and they haven't for many years.

For a while I was buying a multi-box from overseas.

Acuvue Oasys 2-weekly disposables come in a box of 6. ie. 12 weeks ~= 3 months.

You can buy a multi box of 4 of these, so 4 boxes of 6 lenses. Ie. 24 lenses. 48 weeks ~= a year (sometimes I wear glasses).

Ideally, I'd buy one of these for each eye. Total 48 lenses.

I had a supplier in the UK that didn't need prescriptions, bought no problem. They started saying they can't send to Japan but didn't say why.

No problem, I found a new supplier in the UK. Paid by credit card, no immediate problem.

But... Japan customs has blocked it saying there is a law that personal import limit is 2 months (aargh my brand of choice comes in 3-month boxes at the smallest size). This law seems legit, not a new law but they didn't notice in the past.

They were offering to let me keep some, and send most back. I said send them all back. Hopefully I'll get all my money back.

 So, making a new plan:

- buy from an online store in Japan (not one based overseas so no customs problem).

I hope they will be able to send a good amount at a good price. And I hope I don't need a current prescription, because I already know the exact specs that I need. I can get a new prescription if I have to, I'll find an optician or optometrist. I would prefer that it has an expiry date a year or two down the track though. An eye prescription with an expiry date of one month is a money making scam in my book.

...or...

- find a local or semi-local dispensary that stocks my lenses.

Hopefully they'll offer free eye checks in the case that they're adamant about up to date prescriptions. And hopefully the lens prices are ok. I could buy a six pack per eye every three months. But buying a twenty four pack per eye would be even better.  For reasons of cost and time. I live near Nagoya, but not Nagoya central, so if my local glasses/lens ship doesn't offer it, it's still a hassle to go to regularly.

Please post your experiences or advice here! Doesn't have to be specific to Nagoya/Aichi. Perhaps I can still learn a wider truth.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious to know if people have had luck buying contact lenses in quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;one place I went to, asking for a pack of lenses, created a prescription for me, but it turned out the prescription only lasted one month!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been short sighted all my life, worn glasses since 3 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time I get a new contact lens prescription, it&amp;#39;s the same. At my age (40) my eyes don&amp;#39;t change and they haven&amp;#39;t for many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while I was buying a multi-box from overseas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acuvue Oasys 2-weekly disposables come in a box of 6. ie. 12 weeks ~= 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy a multi box of 4 of these, so 4 boxes of 6 lenses. Ie. 24 lenses. 48 weeks ~= a year (sometimes I wear glasses).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I&amp;#39;d buy one of these for each eye. Total 48 lenses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a supplier in the UK that didn&amp;#39;t need prescriptions, bought no problem. They started saying they can&amp;#39;t send to Japan but didn&amp;#39;t say why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem, I found a new supplier in the UK. Paid by credit card, no immediate problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But... Japan customs has blocked it saying there is a law that personal import limit is 2 months (aargh my brand of choice comes in 3-month boxes at the smallest size). This law seems legit, not a new law but they didn&amp;#39;t notice in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were offering to let me keep some, and send most back. I said send them all back. Hopefully I&amp;#39;ll get all my money back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, making a new plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy from an online store in Japan (not one based overseas so no customs problem).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope they will be able to send a good amount at a good price. And I hope I don&amp;#39;t need a current prescription, because I already know the exact specs that I need. I can get a new prescription if I have to, I&amp;#39;ll find an optician or optometrist. I would prefer that it has an expiry date a year or two down the track though. An eye prescription with an expiry date of one month is a money making scam in my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...or...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;find a local or semi-local dispensary that stocks my lenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully they&amp;#39;ll offer free eye checks in the case that they&amp;#39;re adamant about up to date prescriptions. And hopefully the lens prices are ok. I could buy a six pack per eye every three months. But buying a twenty four pack per eye would be even better.  For reasons of cost and time. I live near Nagoya, but not Nagoya central, so if my local glasses/lens ship doesn&amp;#39;t offer it, it&amp;#39;s still a hassle to go to regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please post your experiences or advice here! Doesn&amp;#39;t have to be specific to Nagoya/Aichi. Perhaps I can still learn a wider truth.&lt;/p&gt;

An update.

So my visa renewal went all okay. Great! Yet another one year visa but never mind.

I saw that one of my translations was used in a video on the company social media account and send a little email to say that it turned out great! Then suddenly I get a reply with some more projects my boss wants me to do (yay!) with no specific deadline or anything - just when I have some free time to get them done. Fine.

However, I'm still stuck with the whole answering the phone, (which yes I do try my best to understand but there have been a few times where my lack of knowledge has gotten some customers losing their patience..there's only so far online research can get you) basic input tasks etc. resulting in me not being able to fully concentrate on the projects I've been assigned to. Personally, I feel I would be a lot more efficient if I were to have a better place to work i.e. not sitting next to a phone that rings how many times an hour and actually do what my work contract/immigration documents said I would be doing. I do plan on bringing this up with my boss however.

So I'm halfway there..just need to get my duties decided properly instead of this ""kind of shop worker kind of translator"" position I'm in right now.

Also am I correct that if a reasonable amount of my duties are not applicable to my visa type (specialist in humanities/engineer) that there is a chance that the company/I will be charged for submitting a  fraudulent visa application if too much of my work can be considered 単純労働?

I'm sort of going in circles wondering if it's worth it or not. And if it is, what kind I should get.

Do any of you have such extra health coverage? If so, what do you think?

I was in an accident in May and was hospitalized for 8 days in the ICU. The initial out-of-pocket bill to the hospital was 320,00 yen. But my ward office refunded all but 80,000 yen of that because it exceeded the monthly limit of medical expenses.

In other words, medical expenses are reasonable here. In the U.S. I would probably have had to sell my house to cover the hospital bills!

But Japan also has so-called ""advance treatments (先進医療)  which are not yet completely approved, and are only available at certain hospitals, and which cost extra. One of the features of these extra medical plans is that they cover up to 20 million yen in ""advanced treatments"" which I was thinking might be worth covering.

Right now it's come down to two companies: Tokio Marine Nichido and MetLife. I've met with reps from both.

I'm thinking of going with MetLife, even though I have to buy the policy using my company, because they can't issue policies directly to American citizens for some reason. Canadians - ok. Koreans - ok. Just for some reason they don't do private policies with U.S. citizen. But I can do a contract via my company. The premiums are about the same, but the MetLife benefits are better in these areas:

(1) The first year daily hospital benefits are 100%, not 50% like with Tokio Marine.

(2) They have this ""short stay"" option where they pay 10 days daily hospital benefit for any hospital stay, from 0 through 10 days. After that it's the daily benefit. So say you're in the 5,000 yen/day hospitalization plan and you stay in the hospital 1 day - you still get 50,000 yen.

(3) The extended (indefinite) stay hospital coverage includes cancer, heart disease, and brain disease. With Tokio Marine that benefit just covers cancer. Without that, coverage is limited to 60 days per hospital stay.

(4) They both cover those so-called ""advanced treatments"" but with MetLife they also pay an extra one time benefit in extra cash if you need such treatments.

The question I keep going back and forth in my mind about is which level of plan should I get.

If my main purpose is to just get the ""advanced treatments"" coverage, then I could go for the least expensive 3,000 yen/day hospitalization plan, which would just be 5,447 yen/month. (I'm 63 and had a previous hospitalization in 2012, so my premium is higher than it would be for, say, a 30 year old with no pre-existing conditions.)

But then I think, well, what if I get hospitalized for a longer stay? Wouldn't it be nice to have a higher daily benefit, like 5,000 yen, or 8,000 yen, or 10,000 yen? When you get those higher plans, all the other benefits go up too. Like if you need surgery, you get a lump sum cash payment of 30,000 yen, 50,000 yen, 80,000 yen, or 100,000 yen depending on which course you choose.

The four plans, with the options mentioned above, cost the following per month with these daily hospitalization benefits:

3,000 yen - 5,477 yen  
5,000 yen - 8,941 yen  
8,000 yen - 14,182 yen  
10,000 yen - 17,676 yen

I keep wondering though if those higher plans are worth it since medical treatment is so inexpensive anyway. And monthly medical expenses are capped, and so on.

At my Sunday volunteer class I asked the Japanese students of all ages and nobody has any extra insurance and everybody just uses national health insurance.

That's one possibility too. Just save the premiums for a rainy day.

But I think I would like the ""advanced treatments"" coverage.

- I am Filipino, 25M.
- I finished my Bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering in the Philippines last year but I didn’t make the most out of it so I didn’t learn much.
- I moved to Tokyo in April 2019 to study in a Japanese language school (2 year program). I will be a student (留学生) until 2021.
- My Japanese proficiency is N4. l just started studying N3 (Sou Matome), and I am planning to take the JLPT N3 exam on December.
- I'm also planning to take the TOEIC test on October hoping that I could get a different アルバイト as an English teacher.
- I work 24 hours a week in a factory (工場 アルバイト). I use the salary to pay for my tuition, rent, utilities, groceries, etc.

I want to live here but I'm afraid that the embassy has gotten alot stricter regarding visa renewal. There’s also a negative stigma about Philippine nationals.

Here’s what I need help with:
- How can I prepare myself to be qualified for corporate work and a working visa?
- What kind of jobs can I get into?
- Should I enroll into a vocational school (専門学校) afterwards?

So I noticed that Japanese banks' international cash cards (ATM cards) all seem to rely on a credit card payment processing network instead of an interbank network like STAR. In other words they utilize the same functionality of a non-Japanese ATM that Sally would use to get a cash advance on her Discover card as opposed to directly (?) converting and withdrawing cash in the local currency.

Now, I've not traveled extensively but I have noticed that North American ATM cards are good to go for cash withdrawals at most ATMs I've used in the EU and Central America whereas a Japanese cash card is as good as a coaster once the plane takes off. My question is, what exactly is the Japnese equivalent interbank system (Yucho?) and why doesn't it appear to be compatible such that a regular Japanese ATM card could be used overseas provided it had a magnetic strip?

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any help or advice you can give.&lt;/p&gt;

EDIT: reassuring phrases (I hope!) later in the second link:

""A person born abroad who acquires U.S. citizenship at birth is not required to file an Application for Certificate of Citizenship ([Form N-600](https://www.uscis.gov/n-600)).

EDIT: One of the most frustrating things about politics these days is that it feels like we can do nothing. So, right now, most of our kids are going to be OK, but if you are worried about slippery slopes, here's a short action plan that will make you feel better, as well as being just good, common sense. One size does not fit all.

1. After your child is born, go to the embassy or your nearest consulate and take care of the Consular Report of Birth Abroad. [https://jp.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-family-matters/birth/](https://jp.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-family-matters/birth/) (Strange; it came up as an error today, but a refresh brought it back up.)
2. While you are at it, get your little citizen a passport. This is important for family emergencies, and also for little stuff like making sure baby Lisa Hanako Jones doesn't wind up Risa on her Japanese passport.
3. Document the child's stays in the US. Plane tickets would be a good start (copy with ink that won't fade). Report cards, if applicable. (You may want to document their residence in Japan, too. You never know.) This is for your grandchildren's sakes.
4. Check your state's rules and laws about persons residing overseas.
5. Extra copies of everything at the grandparents/your siblings homes might be a good idea. Digital and physical, if possible.

And if you are the dad of a kid born out of wedlock, do the extra research. I'm guessing you'll want to talk to a lawyer if you want to leave your kid a legacy of American citizenship. Moms of out of wedlock kids seem to have it a bit easier, but CONDITIONS APPLY, so check out the government links above and make sure you are doing it right.

&lt;li&gt;After your child is born, go to the embassy or your nearest consulate and take care of the Consular Report of Birth Abroad. &lt;a href=""https://jp.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-family-matters/birth/""&gt;https://jp.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/child-family-matters/birth/&lt;/a&gt; (Strange; it came up as an error today, but a refresh brought it back up.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you are at it, get your little citizen a passport. This is important for family emergencies, and also for little stuff like making sure baby Lisa Hanako Jones doesn&amp;#39;t wind up Risa on her Japanese passport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document the child&amp;#39;s stays in the US. Plane tickets would be a good start (copy with ink that won&amp;#39;t fade). Report cards, if applicable. (You may want to document their residence in Japan, too. You never know.) This is for your grandchildren&amp;#39;s sakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your state&amp;#39;s rules and laws about persons residing overseas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra copies of everything at the grandparents/your siblings homes might be a good idea. Digital and physical, if possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you are the dad of a kid born out of wedlock, do the extra research. I&amp;#39;m guessing you&amp;#39;ll want to talk to a lawyer if you want to leave your kid a legacy of American citizenship. Moms of out of wedlock kids seem to have it a bit easier, but CONDITIONS APPLY, so check out the government links above and make sure you are doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn't particularly worried until the letter from the police station arrived.

I need to go to the Higashi Kaganawa police office this Tuesday and from what I read online (on websites that are admittedly a little old) got me to panic.

As I understand it, this is a public prosecutor call so it's the worst case of speeding infractions (it's possible that the speed my car was caught at was &gt;50kph over the limit).

I'm looking for some insight on what may possibly happen when I get there. Do I need to seek assistance from an attorney?

I already called the police station asking for English speaking translators, not sure if I'm going to get one.

Anyone had any such experience and can share some details?

I went to the police office in Higashi Kanagawa and the experience has been essentially what essentially what u/tchan82 described in [his reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/cwugch/caught_by_a_speed_trap/eyk43tw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). It appears I was going 63kph over the limit (143 - 80), answered a lot of questions about that day (where I was going and why, did I notice being taken a picture of, was I alone, and a few related others). I have been explained that the case need to be transferred to a court in Tokyo where my car is registered and that there will be a fine (in the 100k space, like u/tokyohoon said) and 12 points lost on the driving licence, which means suspension but the officer didn't know for how long. The officer specified that I got this treatment because this is the first infraction.

I moved to Japan from the UK with my wife a few weeks ago and brought my desktop PC setup with me as it's the equipment I use for my job, though it also doubles up as a gaming pc.  I'd been running it fine in the couple of days since our internet went on to do some work but today I tried loading a game for the first time and the power to the pc and monitors cut off.  I'm pretty sure the ramp in power drain from the gpu overloaded the little travel plug I'd been using (see imgur gallery) as the poor wee guy now doesn't even let me charge a phone through him. RIP little buddy.

Basically I'm just looking for best practice on how to proceed.

Is the simplest solution to get Japanese plugs for my psu and monitors and run those into a japanese surge protector?  Or is this a terrible idea?  Is there any merit to sticking with the uk cables but changing things up at the socket end, maybe spreading them out?  

I have 2 regular double outlets at ground level and an earth pin outlet higher up where the air con would be powered if we had one at that end of the premises.  I can either run japanese or uk cables off regular sockets with or without travel adapters, spreading them out a bit across the room's available sockets, or I could get an earthed extension plugged into that higher up socket and run my appliances off that.

In the living room, we have a 55"" 4k tv from the uk plugged into a similar set up with an identical travel plug.  That socket is also running a uk ps4 and a google home mini.  I'd also like to know if you guys think I should be changing this setup to Japanese plugs or another solution.  Sadly that room has no access to an earth point.

My wife recently gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. Whoo!
(Bit of a long post and a slight ramble)

Up until now I’ve been thinking me speaking English with him whenever I am with him plus having music/radio/TV on with some sort of English speaking going on would be enough to help develop his ear for English. I’m not so sure about this though as I have read articles (don’t remember where from, probably here) in the past about kids growing up here and somewhat rejecting English when they grow up.

Not sure if that was because of the relationship of the parent to their child or whether it was not cool to speak English when the child’s friends didn’t. (or some other reason)

Anyway, I think that developing positive relationships with people who are native speakers is important for developing the child’s positive attitude towards English and maintaining those relationships will help maintain the child’s positive English attitude. 

With this in mind does anyone on here know of any schools (whether they be pre, elemt. Etc.) that teach both Japanese and English in their curriculum with at least some time dedicated to immersive English around the Mito area (are not too far from it)?

I'm having a bit of trouble at work and can't really find answers, hoping someone here can help.

My daughter was born on the 4th of August this year. I really wanted to take time off to take care of her, but since I'm the only one at my company who can do what I do, and me not working would put almost everybody in trouble, I decided that instead of taking my parental leave I would just work remote for a month. I talked about it with my coworkers, with all my bosses, everybody said sure, go for it. I didn't get a written agreement because obviously everybody was fine with it and obviously we're all a big happy family and nothing will go wrong, and I started my remote on the 13th. Everything was fine for the last two weeks.

Now, a couple hours ago, I received a very angry email from my boss asking why the F I hadn't been at work for two weeks, that I wouldn't be paid for that time since it was unauthorized, and reminding me that unauthorized leave was ground for termination.

And honestly... fuck that, I'm not paid enough for that shit, I'm alone doing the work of three people, I was trying to be helpful in the first place, I don't need to take that shit, I'm out. But taking parental leave would definitely help with the transition.

Is it too late to ask for parental leave?

Only info I could find was:

- Parental leave starts 8 weeks after birth
- Parental leave needs to be demanded one month before it starts

And a summary of the dates:

- Birth was on August 4th
- 8 weeks after August 4th is September 29th (a Sunday)
- One month before September 29th is... tomorrow (August 29th)

Do I have to hurry and drop parental leave paperwork tomorrow, or do I have some leeway? Is it possible? What's my best bet?

If anybody had more info or experience about this, that would be greatly appreciated.

&lt;li&gt;One month before September 29th is... tomorrow (August 29th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I have to hurry and drop parental leave paperwork tomorrow, or do I have some leeway? Is it possible? What&amp;#39;s my best bet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anybody had more info or experience about this, that would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

Doctors in the West usually required me to only come in twice a year to pay for the postage of the prescriptions &amp;amp; ask for 1 minute &amp;quot;so no changes? medicine still works? good.&amp;quot; (same as Joe). &lt;/p&gt;

I have some friends coming into town for Christmas this year and they want to do the KFC for Christmas thing (apparently famichiki isn't good enough for them!). However, as you probably just guessed I just do famichiki or Karage every year.

Has anyone ever ordered KFC for Christmas? I heard you have to do it a few months in advance, is that true? Any recommendations in when to place a reservation, how to order it, pick it up, etc. 

I have moderate Japanese so as long as I know when to do it I can probably figure out the rest. But any other tips you can give can on the process will help me fake it and the smoothness look impressive to my friends ;-)

I have a question for those who have taken maternity leave here. Everything I've read says that guaranteed maternity leave starts 6 weeks before the expected due date. Has anyone gone on maternity leave before those 6 weeks? In that case, did you have to use your paid time off to get it? Is this something that would vary from company to company?

edit: I understand that only the 6 weeks of maternity leave mentioned is partially paid, and I'm not looking to extend that per se - I'm okay with any extra time taken before that being unpaid.

But for the past nearly three months I've been dealing with stomach pain and other symptoms. This isn't something I take lightly.

My mom was diagnosed with precancerous polyps at age 50. This was a few months after a family friend died of colon cancer at 4 in the morning on my birthday, in my house. He was 22 years old. A few months later and they found polyps in his dad's colon.

My uncle died suddenly of acute pancreatitis two years ago as well.

I realize witnessing all of this might make me paranoid, but it's also made me realize that life is unfair and hits you hard, and you're never too young. So I've gone to the doctor to address this stitch in my side that isn't constant, but won't go away. My left side feels like someone is either sitting on it or inflating it with air. Sometimes it actually really hurts and doesn't stop for hours.

My doctors keep saying it's GERD. I got a CT of my pancreas and they found nothing, but I later found out that MRIs are better and CT scans can miss something serious if they don't use contrast. Guess what they didn't use? I got tired of my local clinic and went to a city hospital today and was told it's probably GERD and that they'll do an endoscopy. I'm a little distressed. I wanted a colonoscopy (you're supposed to get it at half the age your parent was when their polyps were discovered) but he said I was too young. If the endoscopy comes up with something, fine, but I'm tired of doctors being so ready to slap a diagnosis on it already. I'd rather be tested for the serious things that run in my family first. I told him my history and he nodded along until I was done. I've taken the meds and it made things worse tbh.

I've also had a doctor who hasn't given me an HIV test in over a year despite me asking three separate times because she thinks it's unnecessary despite the fact I'm getting tested after each new partner. I don't feel listened to and have left the doctor's in tears a few times.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, I know, you have to know where to look and Japanese medical care is actually excellent&lt;/p&gt;

I don't want to blog too hard so I'll try to make this short and coherent.

I moved to Japan a few weeks ago as an ALT, it isn't my first time visiting the country, but it is certainly proving to be quite a different experience now.

So I have tattoos, and I'm aware of the social stigma against them and why they are frowned upon in Japan (mostly the historical reasons that just linger). I have a full sleeve on my arm, and I was doing a pretty good job at covering them up. Yet last week I wore a polo shirt with a sports sleeve (like the NBA players wear). I've never had to cover them up back home, so this led me to make an uneducated choice in clothing. Little bits of my tattoo kept creeping up here and there, and the students quickly took notice.

I didn't think much of it until today. My 係長 (BOE boss) came and pulled me out of the teachers lounge to talk about some things. After some time she brought up tattoos, I already knew what she was talking about. Now my Japanese isn't that good (N4), so I really couldn't understand enough to process what was about to happen. But after telling me to please be careful, she just broke down crying, like really hard. I didn't even know what to say, I just remember thinking ""Is it ok to comfort her; should I not do anything?"" I felt grief, embarrassment (for not understanding), and shock. All I could do was continue to ask what was wrong.

After she felt better she went on to tell me that she had gotten her job earlier in the year, and that she's been trying really hard to be happy everyday and do her best, but that truthfully she feels depressed everyday. This made me even more confused, I had no idea why she was telling me this, nor did I know what to say (I just told her that I often feel depressed too).

As much as I wanted to master Japanese right there, or to at least have my phone on me to try and translate (I had left it on my desk, and just didn't want to leave her alone), I just couldn't and we stopped talking about it. Afterwards I contemplated for a long time about why this happened. Initially, in the moment when everything was happening, I thought she was empathizing with me, about how I may be struggling to adjust to life in Japan. In hindsight it was pretty naive and self-centered, but she seems like a nice person so I just assumed she felt bad for me.

But after thinking for a long time, I realize it had nothing to do with me. She was crying because she must've been overwhelmed by her superiors about me screwing up. That's why I never heard anyone complain or mention my tattoos up until then; She took every ounce of shit from her higher ups. She must have been crying in fear of not being able to get her message across, and wether I may make the same mistake again because of it.

This is the first time I have ever felt culture shock, about any culture. Coming here, I knew I was going to have a hard time adjusting to work culture with my tattoos. I knew it was going to be tough and that there'd be a learning curve in the workplace. In the states, whenever I made a mistake at work, I always got the heat for it, in fact I always liked owning up to my mistakes, and hearing criticism so that I could do a better job next time.

But in Japan, no one tells you you're wrong, and when you fuck up, someone else suffers because of your mistake. If I had gotten yelled at, docked pay, or even fired, any of that would have been better than to even imagine someone I believe to be a decent human being hurting because I made a stupid mistake.

How can people live like that? It seems so cruel to have to live under that kind of pressure. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do? What should I do, I'm feeling my personality just isn't going to fit into this kind of culture, and I really don't want to get anyone else hurt or in trouble ever again. I was lucky that I was able to see what my actions indirectly caused, but now the next time I make a mistake i'll probably never even know who I hurt. (???)

With WoW Classic right around the corner, some members of the **Nippon Gamers** Discord (See the /r/japanlife sidebar) have organized and decided on a server to join. 

They will be joining ~~**Oceanic-Arugal**~~ and in general, most will be on Alliance, with a few on Horde as well.
There may be a guild created, too, but it's not decided yet.

If anyone is looking for some people to play with in Japan, please feel free to join the Discord at: **https://discord.gg/gj9bwtG**

There is a chat and voice channel for World of Warcraft in the Discord for any who would like to join :) 

And as always, the Discord is for any type of gamer in Japan, so you are welcome if you want to play battle royales, RPGs, or anything else.

Thank you!

So I've been in the application process for my second work visa renewal. When I first gave them my application last month, I stupidly forgot the resident tax payment certificate, that proved I've been paying my taxes. As I assume many people do, I pay my residence tax in installments throughout the year. This is part of my budget, and unfortunately I don't have much room to pay it all at once.

Well, I'm a little freaked out now. Immigration sent me a letter asking for this year's and last year's tax certificate. Of course last year's was paid in full, but I just started paying the installments for this year's in June. So, the certificate for this year showed that I've paid my first few installments, but that I still have a large amount left unpaid. Apparently, that wasn't enough for Immigration. I got another letter today that said I had to pay the tax in full, and send proof that I did. It also said that I could send a tax exemption form, but would that apply to my situation?

I'm not entirely sure what my options are at this point. Three years ago, I wasn't asked to pay the tax in full when I applied for my visa, and I didn't need to submit any other documents proving I was paying the installments. Which is why I have no idea what to do at this point. Obviously I will call Immigration on Monday to ask if I can send them a certificate or something that shows I am paying the tax in installments, and so far have paid on time. But is that enough?

**EDIT:** Thanks to the help of the wonderful u/Salaryman_66, it seems this issue may be solved\~ After looking at my tax statement again, there was apparently a discrepancy of 11,000円 that I didn't pay. I will say that I have no idea where this number came from. I'm planning on going to City Hall to sort it out, and also call Immigration to see if that's what they were asking for. Hopefully this means crisis adverted, and I'll update if anything else changes.

I first posted in r/Japan but was directed here.

I'm probably leaving in Japan in April 2020 after working in the country for about 7 years. I've paid into the pension system the whole time and have probably spent about 16,000 USD doing so. If I do the standard lump-sum payout everyone tends to do then I'll get back around 9,000 USD.

My question is, I've heard (and read official documents about) there's a way to transfer a Japanese pension to an American one. Has anyone ever done this? Was it fairly straight-forward?

I live in a very small town and doubt anyone in the town hall where I work would know about this process, but maybe I should start there?

Pension has been on my mind for 6 years and stressed me out the whole time. I'd love to not lose that money, but I also don't know if I'll have an American pension set up good to go by the time I leave Japan. And since you have to do the lump-sum payment documents before you leave, I'd lose the window to do that if I tried to connect my Japanese and American (future, hypothetical) pension and then end up not being able to...

And of course if you take the lump-sum out that resets your pension to zero, and I could see a possibility of coming back to work in Japan and then the stress process starts all over! DOES ANYONE HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL I COULD USE THANKS

Like about a month ago there is a guy come in and introduce himself from a newspapers publisher. Talking back and forward he asked where I'm from and etc.. but in the end I said that I'm not interested in it.  (Maybe I shouldn't do this ?) And he also said he will talk the branch in my city that I don't need it. I saw he calling someone the other side didn't pick up at all (fuck up #2?)

I didn't think much of it and a week later if I'm not wrong, my house address is in the delivering list.  
I have no idea how to contact and tell them I didn't sign up for the newspaper.Last week I receive a letter of said newspaper and it has my name, address on it, telling me to sign up for online subscription as well.  
The letter also has the branch number on it so I call them telling that I didn't subscribe from the start to begin with and they should stop sending to my address.  
The person get hold of me talked with a very rude voice and asked how can I have their phone number if I didn't subscribe. I said sure, if I do then bring the contract to my house and let me see my signing.  
He agreed and said he will send someone to my place right away but I waited almost 5 hours and no one show up.  
This about 2pm and I call the branch again, it's the same guy I asked when will your guy show up and he said to me with annoyed attitude:

This caught me by surprise and I being a nice person (stupid shit head) I kinda felt that I did harassing the guy and said I will wait for some more

No one shows up, again!   
So I don't even bother to call them again since they don't even subtract any money from me.

When we arrived two years ago we got a deal with SoftBank for fibre internet along with a mobile phone contact. That’s now finished and they have renewed us for another two years at ¥9,500 a month just for internet - which is more than we were paying for both phone and internet.

We are pretty heavy users - gaming/streaming etc. Willing to pay more for a good service but SoftBank isn’t worth ¥9500 as it’s pretty slow on evenings and weekends.

I have 1 connecting flight in Tokyo. I fly from Fukuoka to Haneda, then from Narita to USA. I have about 3hr 15minutes between the plane landing in Haneda, and the plane taking off in Narita.


I'm a little worried about missing the connecting flight, because after checking the time of the shuttle bus at the airport, it seems like going from Haneda to Narita takes 1hr 40min by airport limousine bus. Plus there is the time it would take me to get off the plane (I'm near the very back), make my way to baggage and wait to get my luggage, then find and buy the shuttle bus ticket.


I'm assuming if everything goes smooth, I would arrive at Narita 45mins - 1 hour before the international flight leaves. But now I am starting to think that might be cutting it a bit a close, since I would still need to wait in line, check my bags, get my boarding pass, go through security etc.


The ticket was purchased directly through the airlines website, not through a site like cheaptickets or expedia etc. So I assumed if it sold a ticket like this, then there had to be more than enough time to make it there on time. However, after finding out the bus takes 1hr 40mins, I am starting to wonder... 



Just thought I'd ask on here if anyone has had a flight like this before and if so, what was your experience?


Thank you!



**Edit:**   Hello everyone, thank you for all your responses and explanations of your experiences. It seemed like most people agreed that this flight is ""possible"" although not really recommended because 1 mistake could easily screw myself over. I decided to avoid the first flight and instead get either an earlier flight, or leave Fukuoka a day ahead of time by taking an over night bus.

Unfortunately ... when I called Japan Airlines and explained my situation, they said they can not change or refund anything. I asked for an earlier flight in the day, or a direct flight to NRT, and she said they are not able to do that. So then I asked if I could just skip the first domestic flight from FUK &gt; HND, but still get on my international flight from NRT &gt; JFK. Again ... she said no I can't do that. She said I miss my first domestic flight, then all other flights on my itinerary will be automatically canceled. So I asked ""Ok well, since I am telling you about it right now, can you cancel ONLY my domestic flight, but keep international, as well as my return flights?"" and she said no, they can't do that. I asked if I am late and miss the flight because the shuttle bus was in traffic, would I get put on the next flight? She then put me on hold for 10 minutes while she checked the policy, then she came back and said ""I'm sorry, if you miss your flight then we can't do anything for you.""



So basically, it seems like I have no choice. I HAVE to check in at Fukuoka otherwise my international flight will be canceled. If I miss my flight for any reason, I lose the ticket and money, as well as having to buy a new next day ticket which will probably be 2-3x the price.

So I’ve been in Japan for about 10 days now (in Okinawa now) and I’m here for a working holiday. I originally took my UK sim out of my iphone 8 and replaced it with a data only sim.

Then I had the problem of being logged out of apps and needing to verify my phone number which was not possible because my UK sim was out of my phone. 
Eventually I put my UK sim into my old iphone 6s, added credit to it hoping that I can receive and make calls/texts. But now the phone still wont make or receive calls. This means I have a number of issues:

- I can’t verify my number on LINE, because I’m not receiving the text verification, and I need to use it to communicate with people and potential jobs etc.

- Anytime I try to send a text out on that phone, or make a call, it instantly fails. Been trying to contact job offerings and I can’t because of this.

-LINE for some reason also won’t let me add other people. When I search for someone the search results are just blank.


I would really appreciate anyone’s help, these past few days I have spent time trying to figure out how to fix these issues. Most phone shops here don’t really speak English so it’s hard to communicate.

For context, my Japanese is pretty crap, about N5 level, but improving steadily with active study and immersion.

I came to Japan at the end of March on a 1 year Working Holiday Visa, with the intention of travelling around supporting myself by volunteering with Workaway hosts for food and board. Asked my first hosts in Shimoda who I stayed with for 6 weeks to help me register with city hall, they said I didn't need to. My second host in Kamishi I was only going to stay with for 2 weeks, so didn't register either, but ended up staying for 4 weeks.


Accidentally ended up becoming a chef at an izakaya in Kochi, Shikoku (basically I said ""can I do a week's trial of the job and sleep on the shop floor?"", boss said ""sure"", an obachan chewed him out for my living conditions after two days so he paid my rent in a sharehouse dormitory). Realising I was going to be here long term I went to city hall to register last month. It was a labyrinthine bureaucratic nightmare in which both myself and the people on the other side of the desk looked terrified of each other, couldn't communicate effectively, and ended up with me being sent round in circles.

At city hall I signed up for health insurance and pension. At the pension desk the woman pointed to 2 forms and asked which one I wanted to sign, but was hurrying me along (or I felt she was, I was pretty anxious) so I didn't really have time to attempt to read them. One of them said ""exemption"" so I chose that one.


Since then I have paid my health insurance in full so I don't have to worry about it. But then pension stuff came in the mail, the little blue book followed by a stack of payment slips.

I am *hella* confused by these slips.

The first one has a full overview of when I need to pay for each month, for example I need to pay July's 16,410円 by 2nd September.
The next says 前納 (prepay?) 129,790円 by 2nd September.
The third says 下期 (2nd half of the fiscal year) 97,660円 by 31st October.
The remainder are numbered from 7-12 and then 1-3 and all feature payment dates from 令和3年


**Questions:**
1. Do I have to pay pension on working holiday visa? All signs point to yes but I'd like to go back to volunteering at some point and I'm worried about money.

2. Can I pay in installments and can I pay in cash at city hall even though my payment slips for this year show totals rather than monthly breakdowns? I don't have a bank account so get paid cash in hand. I don't currently have the funds to prepay that amount.

3. Why do I have slips for the year after next?

4. What's the deal with income tax? At no point in my baffling time at city hall did it seem to get mentioned and I don't know how to pay it.

I'm really worried about budget so did a breakdown this week. My weekly income works out at about 22,520円 but can vary massively, for example this week we closed because of typhoon so I won't get paid for those days. After paying all my rigid bills it looks like I will have about 15,000円 a week for food and everything else, which makes it not so easy to save up to actually see more of Japan. Right now I have 30,000円 put aside but I need to pay my house bills and pension for this month out of that, which will be about 23,500円

Advice gratefully received. I don't want to live a paycheck to paycheck existence in Kochi until I leave in March.

**edit**
8,000 of that weekly income is cash that gets paid into my UK bank account as an unconditional ongoing payment (it's a long story but it's sort of a grant from a family friend). From that account I pay my phone bill, cat-child support to my ex who's looking after my cat in the UK, and sometimes buy things off Amazon.jp, but I can also transfer it to my N26 international account which lets me take money out at 7/Eleven with low fees.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apologies if this ends up long and sounds very naive, I will do my best to summarise.

&lt;p&gt;Accidentally ended up becoming a chef at an izakaya in Kochi, Shikoku (basically I said &amp;quot;can I do a week&amp;#39;s trial of the job and sleep on the shop floor?&amp;quot;, boss said &amp;quot;sure&amp;quot;, an obachan chewed him out for my living conditions after two days so he paid my rent in a sharehouse dormitory). Realising I was going to be here long term I went to city hall to register last month. It was a labyrinthine bureaucratic nightmare in which both myself and the people on the other side of the desk looked terrified of each other, couldn&amp;#39;t communicate effectively, and ended up with me being sent round in circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At city hall I signed up for health insurance and pension. At the pension desk the woman pointed to 2 forms and asked which one I wanted to sign, but was hurrying me along (or I felt she was, I was pretty anxious) so I didn&amp;#39;t really have time to attempt to read them. One of them said &amp;quot;exemption&amp;quot; so I chose that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I have paid my health insurance in full so I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about it. But then pension stuff came in the mail, the little blue book followed by a stack of payment slips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;hella&lt;/em&gt; confused by these slips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one has a full overview of when I need to pay for each month, for example I need to pay July&amp;#39;s 16,410円 by 2nd September.
The next says 前納 (prepay?) 129,790円 by 2nd September.
The third says 下期 (2nd half of the fiscal year) 97,660円 by 31st October.
The remainder are numbered from 7-12 and then 1-3 and all feature payment dates from 令和3年&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;
1. Do I have to pay pension on working holiday visa? All signs point to yes but I&amp;#39;d like to go back to volunteering at some point and I&amp;#39;m worried about money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I pay in installments and can I pay in cash at city hall even though my payment slips for this year show totals rather than monthly breakdowns? I don&amp;#39;t have a bank account so get paid cash in hand. I don&amp;#39;t currently have the funds to prepay that amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do I have slips for the year after next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the deal with income tax? At no point in my baffling time at city hall did it seem to get mentioned and I don&amp;#39;t know how to pay it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really worried about budget so did a breakdown this week. My weekly income works out at about 22,520円 but can vary massively, for example this week we closed because of typhoon so I won&amp;#39;t get paid for those days. After paying all my rigid bills it looks like I will have about 15,000円 a week for food and everything else, which makes it not so easy to save up to actually see more of Japan. Right now I have 30,000円 put aside but I need to pay my house bills and pension for this month out of that, which will be about 23,500円&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice gratefully received. I don&amp;#39;t want to live a paycheck to paycheck existence in Kochi until I leave in March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;edit&lt;/strong&gt;
8,000 of that weekly income is cash that gets paid into my UK bank account as an unconditional ongoing payment (it&amp;#39;s a long story but it&amp;#39;s sort of a grant from a family friend). From that account I pay my phone bill, cat-child support to my ex who&amp;#39;s looking after my cat in the UK, and sometimes buy things off Amazon.jp, but I can also transfer it to my N26 international account which lets me take money out at 7/Eleven with low fees.&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, I came to Japan to work for 2 months on a whv. I didn't get a bank account whilst here and have been paid in cash. I wondered if anyone knew how to transfer the yen to a UK or Australian bank account? The best way I can see is to give the cash to my boss and set him up on TransferWise, but feels like an imposition.

As the title states, I sent 2 boxes home via surface mail in the beginning of June. I've been informed that only one has arrived...which is slightly concerning as I don't see why both wouldn't arrive at the same time.

Another potential issue is that a yellow sticker has been stuck on the box that reads ""goods not fulfilling the conditions laid down in Articles 9 and 10 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community"". I find this odd as surely if there was such a problem with one of the boxes, it would be with the one that didn't arrive...not the one that did. There is no letter stating that there is a problem with the other box, just that sticker on the one that did.

Also, the original receipt is on the box which states that the box is indeed parcel 2 of 2 boxes sent.

Does anyone have any experience recieving boxes from Japan at separate times even if they were sent together?

TLDR; sent 2 boxes but only 1 has arrived so far. Cause for serious concern?

Update: so a letter arrived from the local post office in the UK stating that some customs needed to be paid in order to release the second box (just under ¥4000) and after we paid it, it was delivered with no issues.

Apparently our googling have very different results.. he is concerned that we will not get the visa because of his lack of income, as he will start working from April (my visa expires end of March). 
I've seen some people on here say you need a guarantor usually your SO but many have also said you need someone else? 
In the end we're gonna call immigration as well, but was just hoping to clear this up to ease our minds.

Is there a chance our application will get turned down because of lack of income? Is this where we would need someone to vouch for us? For example his father?

Thanks in advance!

Update: we called immigration, they said we didn't need anything to prove income as I'm currently working, so I guess we worried for no reason. Now we can get married without worrying :)

This would never have been an issue if immigration didn't take a fucking eternity to get things done.

So on the 26th of June I went to the immigration office in Tachikawa to apply for an ""extension of period of stay"", as they say. Gave all the documents and they didn't ask for anything else so I'm thinking all I have to do now is wait. Visa expired on the 7th of August and I'm still waiting but I'm calm because the visa is automatically extended for 2 months.  However coincidentally last year I applied for the renewal on the same date (26th of June, only got 1 year extension) so it's already taking longer than last year. I keep checking my mail every day and getting impatient, I try calling them but their line is ALWAYS busy and I start fearing I wrote my phone number or address wrong.
Today I finally got something, but it's not the notification card telling me to pick up my new visa/zairyu card, their asking me for a few other documents which I should get from my city hall.

Now to my issue, I'm going to be moving. My contract in my current place is until the 3rd of September. So if i can send them the documents and receive the notification card by the the 3rd of September than it's all good, but I doubt that can happen. I've tried calling them to tell them I'm moving but as mentioned above the line is always busy and I have work so I can't try the whole day. The contract in my new place already started but I have yet to start the whole moving and registering at the new ward procedure. 

What should I do? Send them the documents and hope it arrives before my contracts ends in my current place? Send them the documents with a note saying I'm moving and my new address? If so won't they ask for a new Juminhyo with my new address? Can I get city hall certificates with an ""expired"" zairyu card?

Any advice will be much appreciated!

Rant: It took them over a month and a half to tell me they needed additional documents!?!??!?! Yeah sure they're busy or whatever but couldn't they tell me on the day I went to the immigration office I required more documents or at least get a call. What the actual fuck. Also employ more people to answer phone calls so it's not CONSTANTLY busy.

I’ve tried multiple routes including contacting previous colleagues, my former employer directly, his lawyers, Japanese officers from the Labor Office, and an Osaka Labor Union representative.

My previous colleagues are unwilling to push the issue, my former employer will only contact me through his lawyers, the lawyers are drawing it out as long as they can, the Labor Officer had to close the case as there was nothing further he could do, and the Labor Union representative advised that I hire a lawyer that I can’t afford.

I quit with short notice, providing my previous employer only a 1-day notice as my current employer needed a quick turnaround time, or they weren’t going to hire me. The reason that I made this decision was because there were multiple issues that I had to endure with my previous employer that made me feel unsafe and uncertain as a foreigner working in Japan.

In the beginning of 2018, my former employer was paying me under the table for over a 90-day period as my working visa was supposedly in process. I had to e-mail his lawyer multiple times to check the status during this time. I provided this employer with everything that was asked of me prior to my move to Japan. Additionally, my employer asked for my physical passport to help with the processing and I didn’t have it for over two weeks. This was one of the first red flags. What took this process so long?

In January of 2018, a physical contract was given to me, but the rate was incorrect. I didn’t sign it. My former employer told me that he’d update it and send it back. I waited until June to ask again about the contract. I finally received the contract 8 months after it was requested more than four times. Why was he delaying the contract?

During all this time I never received a certificate of employment or a single pay stub, either. After reaching out a few times for the pay stubs he finally sent them in a group covering a four-month period. Why wasn’t he providing these without staff inquiry?

This was a small, new school with very little processes, resources, curriculum, and students. The employer was always difficult to get a hold of and “busy”, leaving many of the decisions up to us even though it was his school and we didn’t have much – if anything- to work with. Why was he so absent in the development of the school?

Because of this I started to look for new work around November of 2018. I found an established school that was interested and had an interview and a follow-up interview. The new employer wanted to hire me, but I declined as my former employer’s school had a no-call-no-show employee that same week. I decided to stay and help rebuild until it was more stable as I felt sympathy for the other staff members that I was working with. I even helped with damage control from a communication standpoint to the parents and community about the staff member’s leave.

After November of 2018, I stopped receiving my pay stubs. Why?

In early March of 2019 I had asked for my tax documentation and he provided an Excel spreadsheet that looked unprofessional. Why wasn’t there any official documentation?

I began looking for work again before my next contract would start, even though my previous contract was never signed. I found potential work in a different prefecture and decided to investigate it further.

At this time my former employer started to “process my visa application” again. This was less than 1 month before my visa was set to expire. During one of my final weeks, I was instructed by my former employer to go to the city office to look for specific documents that were necessary for visa processing purposes. After struggling through the language barrier, the tax office staff informed me that they didn’t have these documents available to give me. They didn’t exist.

Time was running out and my current employer promised to help me process my visa if I were to make the switch. The school was organized, established, and offered me a safer option as a foreigner who was running out of options.

I made the switch only a few days before my next paycheck from my previous employer as it was necessary for my current employer. They were looking for staff in a time-sensitive manner. Staying another year at my former company would’ve been a nightmare and I decided to change.

I never expected my employer to withhold my payment and must go through all of these measures to receive it, especially considering that the labor office of Japan confirmed that I am owed the money.

My former employer told me to contact his lawyers and I’ve been working with them ever since. I discussed this issue with the Japanese Labor Office, and they agreed that my former employer needs to pay me as I was given the pay stub for March but never actually received the payment. Social insurance and taxes were extracted so the payment had to go somewhere. Where did it go?

My former employer argued that I owed him more money than he owed me, pointing to class cancellation fees, furniture removal fees, apartment cleaning fees, utilities, and ward fees. The labor office and labor union agreed that they can’t charge me for class cancellation fees, I have proof that the apartment was furnished before I entered it and left behind only property that didn’t belong to me, I never was told about the apartment contract (cleaning fees) or the ward fees. Though I feel responsible for the utility bills, the rest I don’t wish to pay as they were never relayed to me.

After multiple conversations with the labor officer, the labor union representative, and the lawyers, a physical meeting was agreed upon to be held in the law firm’s Tokyo law office. According to the labor officer, my former employer was to pay me at this meeting, but my former employer wanted to talk and settle the matter further, too. My former employer didn’t show up, was unreachable during the meeting, and I left Tokyo empty-handed.

Now that the labor officer closed the case, I don’t know what my options are. I’m looking for any advice as to how to receive my payment that I worked hard for and deserve. The additional money that he believes I owe him is a separate matter from my payment as a former employee.

Thank you in advance for any direction that you can give me.

**EDIT**: After trying to understand everyone's feedback I realize that I misrepresented the issue by choosing the wrong words. Stating that my payment was ""under-the-table"" implies discretion and secrecy that I was aware of at the time. I meant to say that I was paid in cash, but I didn't believe it to be illegal at the point of receiving it.

I'm looking to get my first credit card here after 3 years, mostly because I think I'm missing out on point accumulation by sticking to cash and debit options exclusively. Honestly don't do a lot of shopping; I'll purchase things from amazon once or twice a month since I'm already shelling out for prime, and all other money generally goes into rent (automatic bank transfer only), refills on skincare stuff every now and then, or the occasional conbini snack or outside meal. 

I do however use a fair bit of money on commissions paid via paypal.jp to people in the states, which I think would net me a fair amount if I charged to a credit card instead. I don't pay utilities, nor do I travel outside the country often at the moment.

Below are the options I've considered, mostly due to recommendation from this sub and googling:


Name | Joining Fee/First Year Fee | Yearly Fee | Points | Pros | Cons
----|--------------------------|----------|------|----|----
Amazon Classic | Free | 1,350 | 2% on Amazon (since I have prime), 1% all else | I uh, use amazon, so I guess that's nice. Apparently decently easy to get. | 1% is kinda average. Can only use points on Amazon. Only MC.
Amazon Gold | 10,800 | 10,800 | 2.5% on Amazon, 1% all else | Travel insurance, Airport lounges, Amazon prime ""free"" | I think you need to sign for ripo to get discounts on the card fees. Kakaku says age requirement is 30+ but website says 20+? Also expensive year fee. Can only use points on Amazon.
Orico The Point | Free | Free | 2% everything for first 6 months, then 1% | Free is nice. Sign up bonus of 1500 points through kakaku. Exchange to many different points. ANA/JAL. | 2% flat is nice, but also not fantastic I guess? 
Orico The Point Premium Gold | 1,950 | 1,950 | 2% everything for first 6 months, then 1% I think 2.5 for orico mall? | Sign up bonus of 1000 points. Exchange to many different points. ANA/JAL. | Not much reason to choose this over the normal version. Might need to use orico mall to make it worth. Only MC.
Rakuten Gold | 2,160 | 2,160 | 1~5%  | 2,000 points from sign up. Easy to accumulate points. Airport lounges, ANA. Convenient and many campaigns. | Will need to use Rakuten to make it worth it, I think. I'm unsure of the points breakdown though.
Rakuten Premium | 10,800 | 10,800 | 1~5%  | 2,000 points from sign up. Easy to accumulate points. Airport lounges, ANA. Convenient and many campaigns. | Will need to use Rakuten to make it worth it, I think. Yearly fee is high. I'm unsure of the points breakdown though.

If any of the above information is wrong, I'll gladly edit. This is just a really rough idea of how i'm reading it at the moment though.

Leaning towards the orico card right now, due to low fees and 2% flat rate after 6 months, but I do understand that it's all going to depend on which place is willing to issue me a card. Ideally I'd like to pay off transactions with the card asap (is manual or immediate bank transfer from my bank account/debit card available or is it always a set day of the month?) as I  don't really like spending money I don't have. 

Any advice on card options or general advice for someone using a credit card for the first time is much appreciated!

&lt;p&gt;If any of the above information is wrong, I&amp;#39;ll gladly edit. This is just a really rough idea of how i&amp;#39;m reading it at the moment though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaning towards the orico card right now, due to low fees and 2% flat rate after 6 months, but I do understand that it&amp;#39;s all going to depend on which place is willing to issue me a card. Ideally I&amp;#39;d like to pay off transactions with the card asap (is manual or immediate bank transfer from my bank account/debit card available or is it always a set day of the month?) as I  don&amp;#39;t really like spending money I don&amp;#39;t have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice on card options or general advice for someone using a credit card for the first time is much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

so, i'm going to sign it. we have no kids, seem to agree on splitting assets, and no concern re visa since i would leave the country eventually. i have two questions.

1. why does she ask me almost daily, if i have signed the paper yet? why the rush? it cant be that she is dying to marry the bf asap. what other things are married women prohibited from doing? i feel like im missing something important...
2. i want to document our agreement to split everything and detail it, and sign it together, so that it's final and she cant revisit to claim more later. is it a thing to include an attachment to the simple divorce form when filing it?

should i visit a lawyer re these things? any references in kansai?

&lt;p&gt;Today I came back from work and got some magazine in the mail, opened it thinking it was the usual spam. I then realized there is a name and address on a paper attached and it is not mine. I cannot figured out how it arrived in my mail, since the zip code written on it is different from where I live (and not even close), it&amp;#39;s just the same city. It was delivered through Yamato (there is the sticker on it).It is not something important or valuable, but still it is something not mine and not intended for me, so how should I go about it? Contact Yamato? Contact the person?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm certain that some other posters around here have more experience, I'd love to hear some corrections, etc.

I roughly translated (with basically a foreignization strategy to ""retain information from the source text, and involves deliberately breaking the conventions of the target language to preserve its meaning"" -wikipedia) the requirements for a person and firearm in order to do the process to become licensed and possess a gun. I chose this very unnatural style, because it was an easier way to study for the Japanese test. Sorry if some of the English seems kinda ""non-native.""

Note: these do not include any of the process which involves months of interviews, written tests, clinic visits, etc. The following are simply eligibility points before any testing or considerations by appropriate authorities. These are the ""main points"" of the law.

Another interesting note: in Japan, your gun license and your gun are tied together. A license does not allow you to buy/own any gun, but simply one exact gun in particular. You (generally) can't use any gun other than your own, including at a shooting range.

Below, ""Gun"" means shotgun or rifle. For most people it will mean ""Shotgun with a magazine of maximum 2 rounds,"" as a rifle possession generally takes 10 years. ""Air Gun"" means the high powered very expensive ones, not the airsoft survival game ones.

So the management company called back on Monday to inform me that my bike has been discarded. Despite the fact that last week they had said to my real estate agent that they would look for my bike and I would have to pay 3000 to get it back. Also they started denying that they had received a phone call in June when they confirmed they'd send a sticker to me. (Nevermind this is on my call history though)

First reaction was actually to call a lawyer. After going through all the details, the lawyer basically said I can't do much because I hadn't recorded the conversation so there would be no evidence if we went to the court.

My last resort was to go to the police, which I did today. Basically the police heard the story, they called the management company and after about 30 mins the conclusion was that there is nothing they can do as well. They said this is between me and the management company to solve and it's not considered theft. I'll go to their office some time next week but I don't have any hopes. They told the police they are happy for me to pop in and discuss about the issue although over the phone they were much more aggressive and rude. 

I guess, it's a 70k lesson to be learnt. Always deal via email with the landlord/management company or record the phone conversation when requesting something.

I just had a brief question in regards to leaving Japan. 

To keep the story short, I am an ALT that is planning to quit, give his 30 day's notice, and then return home to focus on a side hustle full time. The primary incentive for breaking contract (an unfortunate scenario, I know) is money. Student loans and other debts from America have made my time in Japan a bit of a ""nightmare"" - pardon for the use of hyperbole. I recognize it was my fault for underestimating cost of living and income calculations. 

Anyways!!!

So I give my 30 days notice to the dispatch company. I'm sure they may very well withhold my last paycheck, claiming it as ""damages"". But given that they are the contract holders, they have the leverage over me. Fair enough! but once the process of departure begins after the big reveal, what is the proper procedure in how to leave the country? 

I already know I need to cancel water, electricity, gas, internet, and notify the land lord, all of which I will discuss with my dispatch company. I know I need to go to city hall and sign a paper signifying that I will no longer be living in the prefecture. I know I must hand over my health insurance card. AND I'm certain that the rental company partnered with my dispatch company will take my vehicle away. 

But what else am I missing? And given the extreme rurality of my area, how can I make it to Narita Airport when there are no trains or buses near me? 

I'm just curious on your perspectives and experiences to help educate my further decisions moving down the road. This was my first living abroad experience. But one day I plan to return to Japan in a much more advantageous financial state of being.

We bought a car about 6 months ago from one of the bigger used car dealerships. It was only a few years old and had less than 16k km. We got the car for our growing family and it was perfect for us. Fully loaded and we were really happy with it. We paid cash (so no loan in this whole situation) and got their extended warranty. 

2 and a half weeks ago the motor started losing power. It got worse over 24 hours and to the point the car wouldn't drive anymore. We had to have it towed to the dealership to work on. They said no problem, it'll be covered and should be fixed within a week or so. They didn't have any loaner cars at the time, so they made us use our car insurance to cover it. This was the first thing that bothered me, but at the time we didn't have a choice.

A week goes by and the shop said they need to have another shop look at it, as they are unable to fix the car. They knew our insurance rental car time limit would be over in a week, so they said they would be sure to have a car for us of their own. Another week goes by and we had to switch cars, they gave us a kei car. At this point we've been downgraded in car sizes twice, which sucks but shoganai right?

Later that evening, they call us back and tell us the car has been in an accident, by the shop they gave the car to, to work on did it. Turns out that was a Toyota dealership netz, that was next door to where we bought our car (a Toyota). It took a few days to get any real information of what happened. The guy assigned to talk to us about everything, was the mechanic who was speaking to us since we dropped the car off.

This was last Thursday, he assured us we'd get a better sized loaner car, as this may take some time to get resolved. He doesn't call us back until Sunday, tells us the shop that crashed our car is going to give us the same kind of car we originally had/have, but it won't be ready until Friday. We decided to go to the shop and talk to them in person and ask to see the car (I still needed to get a few things out of it anyway). At no point did anyone else speak to us besides the mechanic. No managers came up to say they are sorry, nothing. He tells us the shop that crashed the car probably wants to just fix it and give it back to us. We aren't happy about this, but if it's not that bad, then we can understand it. 

So we all walk next door to look at the car. It's way worse than I thought. The right front fender is completely destroyed, you can't even open the front door. The bumper, one headlight and one of the wheels are the same. To me, it looks like there is almost no way the frame or at least the suspension isn't damaged. We're kinda in shock after seeing it, as they were trying to down play how bad it is. They tell us they are waiting for a 3rd party to come and decide if it's totaled or if it can be fixed and not be considered a repaired car or not. Two people from Netz did apologize to us at this point. The issue the car has only happens when it's driving. They were driving it to test it and ran into another customers car. Which was actually a big work van thing, like a proper sized van. It's front end is pretty damaged too, but no where near as bad as our car.

To us, this car is worthless now. Even if they manage to fix the damage, it's been in a wreck. I'd have to lie to someone to say otherwise. The engine problem itself is still not fixed either. The dealership we bought the car from keeps pushing everything on the place that crashed it. They don't seem to be taking any responsibility for the situation. This is one of the biggest parts bothering me. The place that crashed the car, we aren't their customers at all. They don't have any reason to do more than the bare minimum for the situation. The place we did get the car from though, doesn't seem to be doing anything.

At this point, I'm open to anyone's advice or insight into a situation like this. I have friends in other countries that work in dealerships, but that doesn't exactly apply here. Most people we've asked say we should be raising hell until the shop we bought it from gives us another car. We want to be somewhat understanding of the situation, as it's complicated and hasn't happened with them before (so they say). However, we don't want to get screwed over either and every day we are stuck with a crappier car makes it worse. Should we go back and demand to speak to a manager, call a lawyer, ask our own insurance company for advice? I'm not sure where to go from here. I'm worried they will try and just fix the car and give us back something potentially unsafe and make us lose out on any of the value the car had in the first place. The whole thing has been really stressful.

TLDR: Bought a car with a warranty a few months ago. Car breaks down, take it back to dealership. They can't fix it, they have another shop work on it, they wreck it. Original dealership keeps putting everything on shop that crashed it and we're trying not to get screwed over.

Quick update: Thanks for the advice everyone. There were some things you all brought up we didn't think about. We called the dealership and setup a meeting with the store manager for Thursday. We immediately then called our own car insurance, we don't have time for a rep to call us back today and will talk to them tomorrow instead. We were able to find information on a consumer lawyer consultation. After we speak to our insurance company tomorrow, we will give them a call too. This way, come Thursday we will have better understanding of our rights and situation, before we talk to them again. I'll update this again when we know more. Thanks again!

Update 2: We spoke to our insurance company. They called the dealership where we got the car and then called us back. They said the two companies are now working on giving us a replacement car, this is the first we've heard this. That they are in the processing of figuring it out between the dealership and the shop that wrecked the car. The dealership will call us back with more information. The insurance company doesn't seem to be taking over the situation as much as it sounded like from everyone's comments. We did get the insurance through the dealership, they are affiliated, so I'm not sure if that's a factor here. They told us to just call them back after we hear more from the dealership.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll put a tldr below, it&amp;#39;s sorta a long winded story. &lt;/p&gt;

However, we don&amp;#39;t want to get screwed over either and every day we are stuck with a crappier car makes it worse. Should we go back and demand to speak to a manager, call a lawyer, ask our own insurance company for advice? I&amp;#39;m not sure where to go from here. I&amp;#39;m worried they will try and just fix the car and give us back something potentially unsafe and make us lose out on any of the value the car had in the first place. The whole thing has been really stressful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Bought a car with a warranty a few months ago. Car breaks down, take it back to dealership. They can&amp;#39;t fix it, they have another shop work on it, they wreck it. Original dealership keeps putting everything on shop that crashed it and we&amp;#39;re trying not to get screwed over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick update: Thanks for the advice everyone. There were some things you all brought up we didn&amp;#39;t think about. We called the dealership and setup a meeting with the store manager for Thursday. We immediately then called our own car insurance, we don&amp;#39;t have time for a rep to call us back today and will talk to them tomorrow instead. We were able to find information on a consumer lawyer consultation. After we speak to our insurance company tomorrow, we will give them a call too. This way, come Thursday we will have better understanding of our rights and situation, before we talk to them again. I&amp;#39;ll update this again when we know more. Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 2: We spoke to our insurance company. They called the dealership where we got the car and then called us back. They said the two companies are now working on giving us a replacement car, this is the first we&amp;#39;ve heard this. That they are in the processing of figuring it out between the dealership and the shop that wrecked the car. The dealership will call us back with more information. The insurance company doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be taking over the situation as much as it sounded like from everyone&amp;#39;s comments. We did get the insurance through the dealership, they are affiliated, so I&amp;#39;m not sure if that&amp;#39;s a factor here. They told us to just call them back after we hear more from the dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

Since the Japanese phone will have the access to mobile data and such while I'm in Japan, I wanted to transfer my account to my Japanese phone number, but the solutions I'm finding aren't quite making sense to me. (Note: I am dumb af when it comes to these things).

The 'Account Transfer' option doesn't come up on my Aus Line account. And when I open the Line app on my Japanese phone, it says 'Start', and then asks me to put in my phone number. 

I have email and password on my Aussie Line but no option to log in with email or anything comes up on my Japanese phone, just the imput number.

In the typical survival interest of maximising rebates and points as savings, discussing the various established and newer mobile payment methods below:

* PayPay
* LINE Pay
* Rakuten Pay (楽天ペイ）
* Origami Pay
* D-barai （D払い）
* merPay
* Pixiv PAY
* pring
* Apple Pay
* Google Pay
* Newer mobile payments like FamiPay, 7pay (now defunct)
* IC cards (Suica, Pasmo) (still a form of mobile payment, worth using to reduce loose change, but only really worth if connected to a related credit card with auto-charge function with rebates)

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Personally I only use PayPay and LINE Pay on a daily basis so I can only share about the benefits and downsides of both:

**PayPay**  
(+) Approx. 3% rebates directly in yen (Can directly see how much yen you get in discount)  
(+) More commonly-accepted than most other mobile payments  
(+) Promotions and campaigns (ie. up to 20% cashback at 7Eleven till recently, cash bonus for users who top up their wallets by 7ATM)  
(+) Send money directly to friends' wallets by their linked mobile number  
(-) Rebates take over a month to come back to your wallet  
(-) Topup by credit card requires a Yahoo credit card, otherwise you can top up by 7ATM (in cash) or by linking your bank account

**LINE Pay**  
(+) You can get a physical JCB LINE Pay card directly linked to your LINE wallet so you can make payments at places which don't accept mobile payments or for online purchases  
(+/-) Earn 0.5%-2% rebates in LINE Pay Bonus (cashback credited to your wallet) depending on your Colour  
(-) Monthly sliding rebate system (Colour) which awards you the bonus value for purchases based on what level you are at:  
Green: 2% (Spend 100,000yen or more on LINE Pay every month)  
Blue: 1% (Spend 50,000yen or more on LINE Pay every month)  
Red: 0.8% (Spend 10,000yen or more on LINE Pay every month)  
White 0.5%  
They changed their system on 1 Aug, to give LINE Pay Bonus instead of LINE Points (which you still have to convert back to wallet balance, or you can directly use to spend on stickers or themes at the rate of 2 points = 1 coin)  
(-) Basically you have to keep directing all your payments by LINE Pay to maintain your Green status (2% rebate)  
(-) Ironically JCB is not as widely accepted by many establishments due to their higher fees as compared to VISA or MasterCard  
(-) Send money directly to friends but you will need to know their LINE Account first

What other mobile payment methods do you use, why do you use them, and for what benefit?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the most common mobile payment method which all of you out here use for your daily purchases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the typical survival interest of maximising rebates and points as savings, discussing the various established and newer mobile payment methods below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PayPay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINE Pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rakuten Pay (楽天ペイ）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Origami Pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D-barai （D払い）&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;merPay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pixiv PAY&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newer mobile payments like FamiPay, 7pay (now defunct)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IC cards (Suica, Pasmo) (still a form of mobile payment, worth using to reduce loose change, but only really worth if connected to a related credit card with auto-charge function with rebates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I only use PayPay and LINE Pay on a daily basis so I can only share about the benefits and downsides of both:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PayPay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(+) Approx. 3% rebates directly in yen (Can directly see how much yen you get in discount)&lt;br/&gt;
(+) More commonly-accepted than most other mobile payments&lt;br/&gt;
(+) Promotions and campaigns (ie. up to 20% cashback at 7Eleven till recently, cash bonus for users who top up their wallets by 7ATM)&lt;br/&gt;
(+) Send money directly to friends&amp;#39; wallets by their linked mobile number&lt;br/&gt;
(-) Rebates take over a month to come back to your wallet&lt;br/&gt;
(-) Topup by credit card requires a Yahoo credit card, otherwise you can top up by 7ATM (in cash) or by linking your bank account&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINE Pay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
(+) You can get a physical JCB LINE Pay card directly linked to your LINE wallet so you can make payments at places which don&amp;#39;t accept mobile payments or for online purchases&lt;br/&gt;
(+/-) Earn 0.5%-2% rebates in LINE Pay Bonus (cashback credited to your wallet) depending on your Colour&lt;br/&gt;
(-) Monthly sliding rebate system (Colour) which awards you the bonus value for purchases based on what level you are at:&lt;br/&gt;
Green: 2% (Spend 100,000yen or more on LINE Pay every month)&lt;br/&gt;
Blue: 1% (Spend 50,000yen or more on LINE Pay every month)&lt;br/&gt;
Red: 0.8% (Spend 10,000yen or more on LINE Pay every month)&lt;br/&gt;
White 0.5%&lt;br/&gt;
They changed their system on 1 Aug, to give LINE Pay Bonus instead of LINE Points (which you still have to convert back to wallet balance, or you can directly use to spend on stickers or themes at the rate of 2 points = 1 coin)&lt;br/&gt;
(-) Basically you have to keep directing all your payments by LINE Pay to maintain your Green status (2% rebate)&lt;br/&gt;
(-) Ironically JCB is not as widely accepted by many establishments due to their higher fees as compared to VISA or MasterCard&lt;br/&gt;
(-) Send money directly to friends but you will need to know their LINE Account first&lt;br/&gt;
(-) The LINE Pay JCB card can&amp;#39;t be used for many monthly repeated payments (ie. phone bills, utilities bills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve cleaned up since then, and tried several ways to trap them (using wine or rotten fruits). They work somewhat, but everyday there are just more flies than the trap manages to kill. And I cannot live like this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

It's about the property damage liability to the other party.
The way I know it from my home country, the maximum amount the other party can ever claim is the market value of the car (total loss).

1) Now it seems, as far as I understood, in Japan, a party can always claim the full repair costs, even if the repair costs exceed the market value of the car.

2) From what I understand the insurance companies usually only pay the market value of the car, meaning I would have to pay the difference to the repair costs myself.
My insurance offer includes a special clause that this excess is also paid for, but it's limited to 500.000 Yen.

Now for my questions:
Are the assumptions 1) and 2) correct?

What makes me feel uneasy is that depending on what car I crash to, I still might need to pay a high sum by myself even though the coverage says ""unlimited"".
I can't even estimate if there's a realistic scenario where this might be the case but let's say I crash into a car with market value 400.000 Yen and the repair costs 1500.000 yen. Then I'd have to pay 600.000 Yen myself.

In fact, my first time here was for an intensive study abroad program during university. I was the highest scoring student in my class at that time and very motivated to learn more Japanese (I started at the basic level).

Now that I've returned and been working here for six years, however, my motivation has dwindled. Part of this is due to the fact that my Japanese ability is good enough to handle most daily tasks. I cringe when I hear about other long-term foreign residents who need a friend to help them do something as simple as make an appointment. I'd like to think I'm more independent than that, as I've been doing such routine tasks by myself from maybe about my second year.

Only recently have I had a desire/need to use Japanese at work. I'm currently teaching English part-time at a couple universities. Some of my classes are quite low level, which means Japanese would be useful for giving instructions and I do use it from time to time. I'm hesitant overall though due to the fact that I'm not always confident in my ability to express myself correctly in that setting. It's not exactly a comforting situation speaking to a room of 40 teenagers spontaneously in your second language, nor is it an opportunity to receive good feedback on my Japanese. Basically, it feels that while my Japanese is good enough for daily use, it is nowhere near as fluent as I would need/want it to be to use it at work on a frequent basis.

Another reason I've continued to lose motivation has been the multitude of negative interactions I've had with people in Japanese. I often hear things like ""Japanese people love when foreigners learn their language,"" but that claim hasn't been supported by my experience. People will usually treat me differently than other Japanese customers when I go to a store, for example, before I've even opened my mouth. Even after speaking Japanese, some people can't open their minds to the possibility that I can in fact communicate in Japanese and don't require simple English words thrown into the conversation. People will often stutter or stumble over their own Japanese when talking to me (I guess because they 'don't know what to say' to a foreigner?), which makes me feel really uncomfortable. I feel like I'd have to have more positive experiences than negative ones to eliminate this bias, but that doesn't seem realistic based on my past interactions in Japanese.

I've tried taking private Japanese lessons, joining classes (not for Japanese, but rather for things like sports or music), and going to events hosted by my private Japanese teacher all in an attempt to practice/learn the language, but to no avail. The private lessons are probably the best choice for getting corrective feedback on my speaking, but I've been too busy to go or to study recently (not to mention the fact that they can get pricey). I've even tried organizing days with my SO, who is very fluent although not a native speaker, to speak only Japanese at home, but we've given up on that maybe a month or so after trying each time. The only thing I consistently do to practice is read some manga, which is something I enjoy and will therefore continue doing. While I feel that it is helpful, I also think it has limited applications to real-world Japanese use.

If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to hear about any similar struggles (particularly ones you've overcome) you've had motivating yourself to study Japanese beyond a daily conversational level. Also, feel free to provide any advice you would give to me or others in my situation. I feel like I've touched on many of the common ways to motivate oneself to learn the language, none of which are particularly working for me, but I'm sure there are others I've missed as well.

I just recently moved into my new apartment as I recently relocated here. Out of peace of mind, I'd like to hear some opinions on what is normal for Japanese folks to do for apartment upkeep.

TLDR : my registered and frame-locked-to-front-wheel bicycle was taken either from my university campus bike parking area where it was properly registered or from inside my apartment's fully enclosed bike room, which is closed to the street. what do I do? 

*if all you have to offer is some kinda snide criticism please take out your frustrations elsewhere, this is a genuine request for information or methods. 

I looked around this thread a bit before posting but still at a loss. 

This week I noticed that my 49cm, 1992, Vitus road bike has been stolen. It is a rare french frame that I brought over from America and had re-assembled here. I have had the bike for almost a decade and it is dear to me and also irreplaceable.

At the beginning of July I got a flat tire while on campus in Bunkyo-Ku. I left my bike around campus for two weeks (locked the frame the front wheel.) It was among several other hundred bikes locked in a similar fashion at my University. The bike is registered to me personally ( 自転車 防犯登録 ) and I also have registered it for my university's bike parking. 

Here's the main problem:

Fast forward to mid-July, I stopped by the university around 9 pm to check on something, afterwards it is possible I walked my flat-tired bike home with me for safe-keeping in my apartment's bike park area, but I can't remember. (my mother died in April and I have been kind-of a wreck and not great at keeping track of things lately, struggling to just do simple stuff etc.) Either way, Monday July 15th is the last time I know for sure that I saw it. 

This week I noticed I didn't see it on campus, I assumed I must have brought it home, I checked my apartment's bike park area (essentially a little enclosed room with a door that is always open) but it was also not there either.

In both cases the bike would have been locked frame to front wheel somewhere not easily accessible to the street. 

I have looked at craigslist, and perused yahoo auctions and mercari, but haven't seen anything as of this week. 

Today I enlisted my Japanese friend to help me make an inquiry at the university as well as report it to the police. I provided them a photo and copies of all of my registration information. 

From reading other posts on reddit, it seems very possible the bike will be parted out or end up at a second-hand shop. Are there pawn shops in Japan? Where do I need to start looking? Is there someone I can pay to look for me? My Japanese is survival level and I'm not even sure where to look. 

I guess I assumed that in a country where bike-theft is thought of as a non-issue, and also because my bike was u-locked to itself with a flat-tire my bike would be safe. lesson learned.

I get the part about the pension needing to be paid into for 10-years. That's clear. But what the hell happens to the benefit amount after naturalization? Does it count as zip? Zero? Seriously? How is the benefit then calculated? Let's say I naturalize after six years of paying into the pension system. Then all that is lost towards the benefit system but counted towards the 10-years?

&lt;p&gt;I get the part about the pension needing to be paid into for 10-years. That&amp;#39;s clear. But what the hell happens to the benefit amount after naturalization? Does it count as zip? Zero? Seriously? How is the benefit then calculated? Let&amp;#39;s say I naturalize after six years of paying into the pension system. Then all that is lost towards the benefit system but counted towards the 10-years? So to reach the same benefit amount I&amp;#39;d need to work an additional 6-years to make up for this amount correct? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would the benefits from only having 15-years of pension payments versus 21 years be? Would it be drastically different? Obviously, that would depend on your income and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;

I have read all about carry-on vs cargo, but I would still like some advice or to read about other people's experiences.

I read that the cargo area is totally safe for pets, except there are PETA articles scaring the shit out of me about animals freezing to death or suffocating. My biggest question is how in the world are they able to go to the bathroom/drink water/eat food when you as a human can barely move around in your seat? And for carry-on, it says the pet carrier should be able to fit under the seat -- in what kind of space?? I can hardly put a purse down there. For three cats, would three carriers be required, or could the kittens travel together in one?

Cats usually won't use the toilet without litter involved, so how did you let your cats use the toilet? I read that there would be staff tending to them if they are in cargo, but to what extent?

And for Tennessee, there is no direct flight to and from Japan, and most flights into the US take anywhere from 9-14 hours. We would need to transfer in whatever state is available, usually the closest is Chicago, which is a 1-2 hour flight in a TINY airplane. I guess just renting a car and driving down would be a much better option for them??

Also read something about microchipping and rabies shots being a requirement pre-entry, but the CDC and USDA websites do not mention this. Tennessee requires rabies vaccinations, but is that not something we can do once we get there?

This would be a pretty big move, would you recommend flying with the cats once we ourselves have moved all of our things and gotten a bit settled (or vice versa)? That way we can pay more attention to the cats/have less luggage on our hands when we go.

ANY advice at all on this subject would be a HUGE help. Thank you in advance!

So, I am living in Japan, and am pretty engineering and tech oriented when it comes to interests. Do you guys have any recommendations as to museums, buildings, hidden gems, that are in connection with stuff like cars, trucks, trains, rockets, heavy machinery, anything military, ships, dams etc... For example, I just realized there is an open day for the US military base (Yokota air base) sometime in August. Things like that...

Any input is appreciated! Thank you very much in advance!

By the way, I am located in Yamanashi, but I am willing to travel.

 Thanks for all the comments so far, including the  japancirclejerk-like ones, whose authors seem to know more about my background/living circumstances than I do. 

Hello swarm intelligence, I hope someone can help me with this question/situation:

I work for a Japanese automotive parts supplier which only recently started hiring foreigners. Even though the company has been emphasizing the importance on ""global labor"", it soon became apparent that there is no communication/ long-term agenda / career plan for us foreigners whatsoever.

I knew that there would be a mandatory 3-month period in production, but instead of a genuine introduction to the company, it is basically the most monotonous assembly line work, consisting of doing the same combination of movements within 26 seconds for sometimes 12 or more hours and regular night shifts. All Japanese 新入社員 have to do it, and while I like the idea of getting a special treatment, I also earn as much as my Japanese dōki with less qualification/experience. I a have masters degree/JLPT N1 and 3.5 years living experience in Japan. 

My regular position turned out not to be designated for foreigners as all my predecessors are Japanese.  Thus, 95 percent of my daily tasks are in Japanese and as there is little actual need for a foreigner, for which reason I feel little valued as the グローバル人材 I was hired as. 

While I try to stay positive and think of this a rare opportunity to experience a traditional Japanese company, I am not sure if I want to sacrifice 3 month of my life and perhaps my health (a significant number of people suppering from health or mental issues), only to return back to the office job that also pays less than I thought (different story).

Before drifting off to much, I would like to know if anyone know if the above-mentioned factory work is legal for a category e visa (""As Eng./Sp. In Human./Int. Serv.), as I heard the the actual work is restricted to the respective field. 

I am not unhappy with the company in general and my coworkers are mostly friendly, plus the company subsidizes my rent,  so I think labelling the company as burakku would be too easy.

Any honest opinion is highly appreciated!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;edit: sorry, what is meant is &amp;quot;category E&amp;quot;, not 3.&lt;/h1&gt;

I'm a bit confused about the Lump Sum withdrawal thing for the pension.

[https://imgur.com/a/1RuASnm](https://imgur.com/a/1RuASnm)

This above image shows the pension payment table that is on the form you get when requesting a lump sum repayment.

It says if I have worked say 24 months, I will only get back ¥180,480.

Over the last 24 months, however, I have paid around ¥500,000 (not including employer matching, just direct from my paycheque).

Initially, I thought that I would get the entire amount I have paid in over the last 3 years as long as I did all the forms and did the tax refund one too.

Now seeing the form though, it appears that I don't get the full amount? I am confused as I have read some other stories of those who have left Japan and gotten their full ¥500,000+ pension lump sums back (after filling in all the forms including the tax refund form).

If anyone has been through this or has some experience, could you please help me clear this up. I tried searching for old posts but could not find anything that specifically explains this.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made a very similar post in the stupid questions thread but would like to make a post about it too if that&amp;#39;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

The bathroom is clean and there’s nothing for them to feed on in there, so I don’t understand what it is that they’re attracted to. The eggs look like sesame seeds and are about the same size. I looked up drain flies, which look like tiny moths, and these don’t look the same. 

They’re not extremely attracted to the garbage, and are apparently coming in a second wave despite the fact that I can’t find any more eggs in the tiny room.

There is a vent in the bathroom. It looks pretty closed off, but I guess it could be involved.

These assholes: https://terminixno.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/phorids-museum-268x300.jpg

According to Google, they like gross organic matter, so they likely arrived when I was busy and missed a couple trash days the other week. I thought it was all fine tied up, but I was fooled. The trash departed but the flies stayed. Disgusting.

For anyone having this exact problem: look around in dark places near the places you’ve seen the fuckheads for the eggs/larva to kill/sweep them out and sanitize. Use that massive homosapien noodle. I found a couple more where I’d already cleaned, then removed all my pots from beneath the sink (right across from the toilet room) and found a good bit under those. They lay eggs in the dark but then mature to be attracted to the light, go figure. When I just displaced them and kept the light on, I was able to trap a shit ton of them on the tape.

Haven’t seen any since, but too early to tell—if they’re there, the soap and ACV trap hasn’t nabbed any yet. Apparently they’re a bitch to get rid of. Maybe I get lucky and they’re already all in Hell.

You may have heard about the test. You may have heard that it is quite difficult. You may have heard that everyone fails on their first try and most people take about two tries before they pass. You may have heard all of these things and more, but I am posting this to give you hope of a more positive story and to dispel some of the things you have heard.

I took my driving test a few days ago and passed on my first try. It is not as difficult as you may imagine. It is a course test so there are no unknown variables to get in your way.

Here are some of my thoughts on why it seems like such a difficult task and how you can give yourself an edge going into the test.

**First, it's not that big of a deal.** You must know that although you may have heard that the test is impossibly difficult, it isn’t. It’s a normal test with rules that need to be obeyed in order to pass. As long as you do all of those things you will pass just fine. It is not an impossible task.

**Second, psych yourself up, don’t psych yourself out.** Most people vilify the test and completely blow it out of proportion until it becomes a massive obstacle that you will fail at least once. What this does is it causes you to worry about failing even before you have begun. When you plant these ideas in your head, you start to expect to fail. When you expect to fail you will probably fail. Instead, you should psych yourself up to taking the test by building confidence and believing in yourself. Plan to pass the test, don’t plan to fail the test. 

**Third, confidence is key.** Believe in yourself and your ability to drive. You’ve passed a test in America and you’ve been driving for a whole year in Japan. You know how to drive, so just prove it to the test proctor. Visualize yourself completing the maneuvers properly and completing the course with a passing grade. Just drive like normal on the course. Don’t drive extra slowly or focus on the proctor sitting next to you. Definitely don’t focus on possibly making mistakes. Drive normally and according to the protocol and you will do just fine.

**Fourth and finally, preparation is key.** This one is actually really important and plays a large role in the amount of confidence you will have going into the test. Make sure you have all three courses memorized before you take your interview. This will make sure you have the confidence that you need to make the turns and maneuvers confidently when it comes time to take the test. Be sure to practice the proper driving protocol in the real world when you drive to work in order to get used to it (e.g. doing a three point check when turning on your blinker etc…). You can even practice performing cranks in an empty parking lot if you need to. I didn’t have to practice on a course prior to taking the test but that option is also available if you feel you need it. There are strategies online and probably available from your local AJET group, take note of the advice of other people who have gone before you and make sure you don’t make the same mistakes as them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got a MEXT Scholarship and have been here in Japan since April to study Japanese and familiarize myself with my lab and research.

I am about to enroll in a master's degree at Tier 2 Japanese University starting in October, the degree will be taught in English.

**I have mixed feelings about what I'm gonna go through, one of my minds says YES the other says NO**  
**The YES:**

* I feel like I am able to learn what I'm interested in in my lab.
* my professor is also an ""international-minded' person, as he spent 10 years abroad.
* The lab is consists of 50% Japanese 50% international students, so I don't feel lonely cause there's always be another ""gaikokujin"" whom I can talk with.
* The professor speaks English although not really fluent, but he's kind and open to discussion.
* I didn't have a really good undergrad GPA, no achievement whatsoever, therefore earning this scholarship was a blessing to me, my undergrad university was ranked quite low in QS so getting here feels like I've upgraded myself

**The NO &amp; My Dream:**

* I have a dream to experience a tech-related internship or career in the US/UK/Europe, meanwhile, *I am also concerned about the quality of education* I'll receive here, I read a lot of comment stating that degree from Japanese University is worthless in the western country.
* It will take 2 years to complete this degree, so I just don't want to waste the next 2 years of my life doing things that are not contributing to my goals/dreams.

They usually last only a week or so back in the US (for me) but here, they seem to just not go away.  Plus, the itch is so much more intense from the Japanese critters -- it's torture!

Summer is here and I just got my first mosquito bite.  I have used a method of relieving the itch, as well as shortening the time the bite lasts by a pretty simple method.  My family has been using this method for a few years (kids included), so I thought I might suggest it to fellow people living in Japan.

The method is simple: apply direct heat to the bite.  Nothing more.  I had read several years ago that the itch from a mosquito bite comes from an enzyme it releases to ""numb"" the area while it feeds.  However, heat breaks down this enzyme, resulting in reduced itch.

I am using just a regular hair dryer, set to maximum heat.  My hair dryer is not the hottest, so be careful with yours.  Turn the dryer on, directly aiming at the bite.  I keep the end of the dryer about 1-2 inches away from it.  Again, be careful!  You will feel a sharp pain at the bite, but it should be bearable.  Hold the dryer there for 10-20 seconds (longer if you can) then release.  Allow the bite to cool down, then repeat.  This requires a certain pain threshold, but for me, a bit of pain is better than crazy itching and scratching.  After heating the bite 3-times or so, you're done.  What remains is residual pain which should subside in about a minute or less.  Avoid scratching at this time -- just deal with the bit of pain.

No more itching...!  For a while, at least.  I do this each morning after I shower, and at night, if it gets itchy again.  It works so well for us that my kids specifically ask for it when they also have a bite.

Anyway, hope this helps you, too.  And I hope JCJ doesn't find something in here to crosspost it!

Hold the dryer there for 10-20 seconds (longer if you can) then release.  Allow the bite to cool down, then repeat.  This requires a certain pain threshold, but for me, a bit of pain is better than crazy itching and scratching.  After heating the bite 3-times or so, you&amp;#39;re done.  What remains is residual pain which should subside in about a minute or less.  Avoid scratching at this time -- just deal with the bit of pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No more itching...!  For a while, at least.  I do this each morning after I shower, and at night, if it gets itchy again.  It works so well for us that my kids specifically ask for it when they also have a bite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, hope this helps you, too.  And I hope JCJ doesn&amp;#39;t find something in here to crosspost it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ps- could anyone recommend a decent non-deet repellant?  Deet just smells so strong.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to a Google Search last night I realized you need to connect a router to a modem to make it work. I've asked Docomo since I had previously used their Hikari and they said they can't service my room, so I'm guessing the next best option is to buy my own modem. Here is a picture of my [wall outlets](https://imgur.com/a/Ktyr0XH), I'm assuming the dome shaped thing on the top left above the LAN port is where the cable for the modem goes? Is it even possible to buy your own modem in Japan?

I currently own [this router](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E7%84%A1%E7%B7%9ALAN-RT-AC68U-600Mbps-%E6%9C%80%E5%A4%A718%E5%8F%B0-iPhone/dp/B00GJIEYBI/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=rt+ac+68+u&amp;qid=1564107619&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2). A preliminary Amazon search didn't particularly come up with any good modem candidates but I can keep searching.  I'm also not far from Akihabara is that's a better place to check.
